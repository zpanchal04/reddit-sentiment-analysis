11djwh8,Business idea: Computer-Generated Influencer Agency,this week’s idea is a bit out there it involves using ai a lot of creativity and a bit of imagination new influencers are popping up on social media attracting millions of followers and generating millions of dollars but there’s something different about these influencers… they’re not real that’s right they’re fake computergenerated people like miquela aka lilmiquela instagram miquela isn’t real but that hasn’t stopped more than million people from following her and people from joining her discord so how can we use this trend to make some money the idea create an aigenerated influencer agency think about this like a modeling agency or music label you have an entire roster of influencers but you decide everything they do and receive all the money they make this is relatively easy to get started with but growing a following will be the challenge you can use a tool like midjourney or photoai to create the photos and upload them to instagram like a real influencer would the key is to build a storyline around the influencer that will make people want to follow along for example do they have a boyfriendgirlfriend where do they travel to what are they good at what are their hobbies etc this part will take some imagination and will also allow you to create a story for multiple characters now let’s talk about how we can actually make money from this one way would be to work with actual brands and promote their products to your following or you can focus on building your own product like a paid community merch or even paid follows through a platform like onlyfans i know this whole idea sounds a bit weird but it’s already happening so why not jump on the trend take magazineluiza for example a fully computergenerated influencer with over million influencers and the creators behind this account are using it to promote products and brands and thats a wrap want more content like this subscribe to my newsletter to get a new side hustle idea every week,week idea bit involves using ai lot creativity bit imagination new influencers popping social media attracting millions followers generating millions dollars something different real right fake computergenerated people like miquela aka lilmiquela instagram miquela real stopped million people following people joining discord use trend make money idea create aigenerated influencer agency think like modeling agency music label entire roster influencers decide everything receive money make relatively easy get started growing following challenge use tool like midjourney photoai create photos upload instagram like real influencer would key build storyline around influencer make people want follow along example boyfriendgirlfriend travel good hobbies etc part take imagination also allow create story multiple characters let talk actually make money one way would work actual brands promote products following focus building product like paid community merch even paid follows platform like onlyfans know whole idea sounds bit weird already happening jump trend take magazineluiza example fully computergenerated influencer million influencers creators behind account using promote products brands thats wrap want content like subscribe newsletter get new side hustle idea every week

vbu5yy,Ash isnt actually that far off from our current timeline,technically ash was a thing before black mirror the only difference is our ashes are robotic not synthetic flesh a lot of people eg in japan have been able to create fake ai to fall in love with they make anime characters and marry or date them like martha did on text and call alternatively some ppl get into relationships with actual robots or sex dolls these robots are literally created to be as humanoid as possible eg the case with sophia the robot given her face isnt as humanoid but shes made legit presentations like a human public speaker its creepy as fuck but not far off from what ash is a fake human or significant other in some cases to replicate a real one sophia was actually based on audrey hepburn obviously they dont have simulated skin but the point is still the same and like marthas case sometimes the fakes are used in place when there is a lack of a real so we also have literal virtual instagram stars who are just pure ai like that one instagram model named miquela lilmiquela its creepy proof that ai can get real far if more thought was put in we also have that weird fake skin mousepad stuff but im not finna talk ab it😭💀,technically ash thing black mirror difference ashes robotic synthetic flesh lot people eg japan able create fake ai fall love make anime characters marry date like martha text call alternatively ppl get relationships actual robots sex dolls robots literally created humanoid possible eg case sophia robot given face isnt humanoid shes made legit presentations like human public speaker creepy fuck far ash fake human significant cases replicate real one sophia actually based audrey hepburn obviously dont simulated skin point still like marthas case sometimes fakes used place lack real also literal virtual instagram stars pure ai like one instagram model named miquela lilmiquela creepy proof ai get real far thought put also weird fake skin mousepad stuff im finna talk ab

gua096,"The future of digital influencers, like Lil Miquela. What do you think? How impactful will they be in the future?",artificial intelligence ai is an increasing worrisome discussion in todays society many people assume that if you adopt a robot to do a humans job the human is therefore not needed although while the use of ai in the workplace is on the rise few understand how it will affect our jobs the implementation of the technology will bring both challenges and opportunities but will it be positive for us in one aspect ai is collaborating alongside ‘human resources’ in companies is to ensure businesses make the most beneficial decisions that ensure they thrive collaboratively with ai one way this is being successfully promoted in the workforce is its prospective advantage in increased productivity repetitive tasks are completed by ai in a faster and more accurate manner giving professionals more time to work on humancentric tasks an article written by chethan kumar ‘artificial intelligence definition types examples technologies highlights that “ai shouldn’t stop at reaching the human level it must go beyond the capabilities of humans for it to reach its peak potential” kumar he specifies these ideas through the following definitions the ability of a digital computer or computercontrolled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings a machine completing the tasks which involve a certain degree of intelligence which was previously deemed only to be done by humans is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines especially computer systems these processes include learning reasoning and selfcorrection the capability of a machine to imitate the intelligent human behaviour this is related to lil miquela and other digital models whether you call them digital entities robot influencers cyber models cgi models they are all virtual avatars created via d animation software with current advances in ai and technology these models appear as human beings although lacking in physical form these influencers have developed personalities that people connect within the comments section of their online profiles specifically instagram many ai models have developed political views and have identified themselves as part of racial social or gender groups others are more upfront about being cgi and the developer is clear about their participation with the account it can be argued that these models have adopted the concept of ‘mechanical learning one of many ways in which ai can be achieved 📷 chethan kumar elaborates on machine learning with it being a “method where the target goal is defined and the steps to reach that target is learned by the machine itself by training gaining experience” kumar one can argue that this idea is prominent with lil miquela gaining experience in the social media world to continue to grow as a successor this would also come from her engagement with other users in the comments as mentioned prior this engagement can be viewed as a ‘natural language processing which is broadly defined as the “automatic manipulation of natural language like speech and text by software” although in a short term future of life online the increase in activity on social media platforms specifically instagram the one aspect that ‘normal’ influencers reign over cyber models is intimacy and well ‘real’ connection however these models adopt machine learning and natural language processing to develop skills to create the presence that they are currently doing so well jaeeun shin and sangwon lee on this concept through their research on the ‘intimacy between actual users and virtual agents interaction through “likes” and “comments”‘ they conducted quantitative research from current virtual influencers on instagram to analyse the idea that actual users on instagram want to engage with these entities the reasoning for this was to find out how the number of ‘likes’ and ‘comments’ are associated with the photography and caption it was found that people have tendencies to leave more ‘likes’ and ‘comments’ on posts where virtual agents express their emotions they concluded that emotion and relationship between virtual agents themselves stir up strong interest actual users on social media 📷 fig rank by number of “likes” of emotion expression ulilmiquela 📷 📷 looking into the latter of the short term years current influencers will experience significant change in their marketing techniques there is an ease for cgi influencers to be completely controlled by the brands wishing to use them this is an unpredictability that comes with reallife influencers and can be avoided with current influencers digital models at the moment like lil miquela are becoming increasing popular amongst current celebrities due to the trend of the digital environment 📷 📷 lil miquela with dr woo a famous tattoo artist with millions followers cgi influencers increase in popularity also led me to think about the concept of technological singularity within the online world vernor vinger coined the term defining it as “a hypothetical point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilisation” is this conception of digital influencers the beginning of technological singularity according to joichi ito director of the mit media lab team member of the council on extended intelligence highlights “the only ones who are currently benefiting from artificial intelligence technologies are those who master them those who live within what he calls the ‘singularity bubble’ while the rest of us are left outside the conversation as passive users of overwhelmingly powerful technologies”ito the way this can be interpreted is digital influencers are ‘mastering’ the online world – and will only continue to control this in the short term as its popularity increases these digital entities are living within the ‘singularity bubble’ the ones on the outside are those user of instagram who post photos of themselves as human beings the problem surrounding technological singularity is the fact that there is an implication that the future is “where a superintelligent technology supersedes human reason and becomes a sovereign and threatening entity” we as a society have become essentially bored with our immediate reality the likes and comments on instagram were inevitably not worth enough of our time by transferring reality to an online avatar we “let the machine perform” – relating to machine learning media coverage that surrounds ai and super algorithms has inevitably helped inflate the possible consequences of such an exponential growth of machine intelligence – the fear that ai will take our jobs conclusively it is through this want for attention in society that number of digital models are increasing proving that we can work collaboratively with ai in the short term adam rivetz cofounder of the influencer marketing company ‘paid’ believes that current influencers will use cgi technology to create their digital avatar for the efficiency of brands as mentioned above rivetz stated in an interview that “they could make a duplicate version where it’s like ‘this is my reallife feed where i post certain things but then here’s my avatar of myself where maybe i work with different brands or do more risqué things” rivetz emily groom accredited with the creation of cgi influencer lil wavi is also optimistic about the future of influencer marketing “soon we’ll see digital models walk down the runway through holograms as we dig way deeper into the future there’s so much potential and i’m excited to see where it goes” – emily groom interview with vice,artificial intelligence ai increasing

ayhpxv,Important Theories,okay this is my third time trying to type this up and its so frustrating im choosing to keep my identity a secret because yes i want people to read this and know about it but i also dont want people to know me im a regular person except i might be a bit different im always paying attention to new things or things in general i can never have enough information i pay attention to detail and ive come up with new ideas and crazy informative theories and i hope it will in courage you to do your own thinking and paying attention question everything because this is some real shit and these are only a couple things ive thought of okay so ai technology is already crazy enough i hope you guys have heard about the real life robot sofia she looks almost human but a little more plastic and they dont put hair on her so you cant confuse her for human but i question why she doesnt look more realistic i mean it would make her scarier but it seems like something that should be done you know since science is heading that way anyway because think about this celebrity wax figures look real as hell i have personally been to one of the museums so if they can make those figures look real why cant they do that to sofia my theory is that there are already robots just like us we cant tell it apart sofia is just something that is subliminally getting us used to the idea and maybe the wax figures are just old robot celebrity skins or clones or have you heard of the instagram star lilmiquela i think she might actually just be an entire robot and theyre still trying to fix her body more and i think she might be a robotic pop star in an interview with conspiracy theorist shane dawson she was ask who she was and she was just like im me and thats kind of how some of our small ai machines dodge our questions i think its something for the future next theory tiktok now i know damn well im not the only one tired of this shit so i started thinking where the fuck did this shit come from i think its meant to manipulate children half of the videos i get ads for the person in the video has their mouth moving to something else while the song is playing one thing i saw one ad where the girl was doing a symbol and sometime a song or tune will be high pitched i guess for the sound to mind control or something of that theory for these next ones i just want to say that if this post blows up and they start to look for me for who i really am and they try to get rid of me i will have my family reveal my identity these are just theories and im not a racist but this has to do with the white race and other things and its kind of crazy bare with me i feel like the first ever people were actually brown colored not black but more like indian or hispanic color i think white people came later and they didnt want to be the wrong race you know so they had to be more superior now i dont know exactly when it all started but the white people made it to where nobody talked about how the colored people came first there is no way that the bible took place in the middle east with white people that should be obvious now im not sure if this is true but the book of enoch was removed from the bible because white people didnt want other races to read it and think that white people were bad now you might think why would that book make us think that thats because enoch had a son who had a son which was noah and noah was an albino or the first person to be born with white skin now in the book it was said that everyone thought he was the son of an angel that the angels were having children on earth now maybe this could tie in with greek gods and demigods or maybe this could mean that white people were created by the fallen angels the ones that chose to fallow satan and were cast down to earth noah was described as white and red and check this out black or brown people can be in the sun yeah our skin peels sometimes or we get tanned but we dont turn red white people turn red and you know what else is red demons the devil and from personal experience i do believe in god and the bible but there is twisted shit going on with the information and i used to be a type of buddhist where i was at peace with the earth and universe and i bbn loved plants and nature and good energy i didnt really have a religion for it thats just how i felt and i was happy like that when i first started believing in god i was happy but now im finding myself becoming depressed again anyway i brought that up to bring up america and how the native americans were here first then the white men came now of course we have learned in school that native americans believed in spirits and energy and they used plants and herbs as medication and they survived like that for years but the white men came at hey wanted to be better and they saw how happy these little indian people were and went uo to them and said something like oh you have all these gods well we have one god and hes better than all of your gods combine and if you dont believe in him then hell kill you or something like that and its really fucked up because the white men took the native americans daughters and raped them and gave them diseases and just slowly killed there population i have more theories about being in a simulation and the illuminati but ill just end it with this guys nothing is just one thing start questioning everything fucked up shit is going to go down were just getting closer and closer,okay third time trying type frustrating im choosing keep identity secret yes want people read know also dont want people know im regular person except might bit different im always paying attention new things things general never enough information pay attention detail ive come new ideas crazy informative theories hope courage thinking paying attention question everything real shit couple things ive thought okay ai technology already crazy enough hope guys heard real life robot sofia looks almost human little plastic dont put hair cant confuse human question doesnt look realistic mean would make scarier seems like something done know since science heading way anyway think celebrity wax figures look real hell personally one museums make figures look real cant sofia theory already robots like us cant tell apart sofia something subliminally getting us used idea maybe wax figures old robot celebrity skins clones heard instagram star lilmiquela think might actually entire robot theyre still trying fix body think might robotic pop star interview conspiracy theorist shane dawson ask like im thats kind small ai machines dodge questions think something future next theory tiktok know damn well im one tired shit started thinking fuck shit come think meant manipulate children half videos get ads person video mouth moving something else song playing one thing saw one ad girl symbol sometime song tune high pitched guess sound mind control something theory next ones want say post blows start look really try get rid family reveal identity theories im racist white race things kind crazy bare feel like first ever people actually brown colored black like indian hispanic color think white people came later didnt want wrong race know superior dont know exactly started white people made nobody talked colored people came first way bible took place middle east white people obvious im sure true book enoch removed bible white people didnt want races read think white people bad might think would book make us think thats enoch son son noah noah albino first person born white skin book said everyone thought son angel angels children earth maybe could tie greek gods demigods maybe could mean white people created fallen angels ones chose fallow satan cast earth noah described white red check black brown people sun yeah skin peels sometimes get tanned dont turn red white people turn red know else red demons devil personal experience believe god bible twisted shit going information used type buddhist peace earth universe bbn loved plants nature good energy didnt really religion thats felt happy like first started believing god happy im finding becoming depressed anyway brought bring america native americans first white men came course learned school native americans believed spirits energy used plants herbs medication survived like years white men came hey wanted better saw happy little indian people went uo said something like oh gods well one god hes better gods combine dont believe hell kill something like really fucked white men took native americans daughters raped gave diseases slowly killed population theories simulation illuminati ill end guys nothing one thing start questioning everything fucked shit going go getting closer closer
appu3m,The Mystery Of Lil miquela,,
9hup30,"So, this is my take on lilmiquela in The Sims 3",i listed all the cc in my tumblr post edits are ridiculous but i think she resembles the real thing anyways the download link is in the said tumblr post,listed cc tumblr post edits ridiculous think resembles real thing anyways download link said tumblr post
8dhkof,lilmiquela now has a storyline!,don’t know if instagram and spotify’s lilmiquela counts as an arg but i’m actually a bit disappointed in the story that has come about i wish she’d continue being an artist and slowly unfold something less unoriginal than “hey i’m a robot” however i am excited to see what’s next what do you guys think,know instagram spotify lilmiquela counts arg actually bit disappointed story come wish continue artist slowly unfold something less unoriginal hey robot however excited see next guys think
8div08,Who or WHAT is Lilmiquela!?,as of recently instagram “model” lilmiquela has been blowing tf up i personally found out about her from shane dawson’s channel after watching shane’s videos on her i started to delve into some more conspiracy theories as to whom or what lilmiquela is within doing my research i found it mindboggling that everyone failed to mention what seems like the obvious lilmiquela is not a sim or a d model for upcoming fashion companies i believe she is in fact a d model for a computer software site called dazd i mean even a simple google search of “dazd models” is more than enough proof here is a beginners video on how to make the models model in creation its a very detailed process which is why miquela looks somewhat “lifelike” or “real” but is clearly not this software has been around for quite some time now and is relatively popular i also think this recent “hacker” on lilmiquela’s page is just another model from the dazd site in all seriousness if lilmiquela is a d model used from this site than mad props to the creator cause heshe is very talented and probably laughing at these theories behind their m followers,recently instagram model lilmiquela blowing tf personally found shane dawson channel watching shane videos started delve conspiracy theories lilmiquela within research found mindboggling everyone failed mention seems like obvious lilmiquela sim model upcoming fashion companies believe fact model computer software site called dazd mean even simple google search dazd models enough proof beginners video make models model creation detailed process miquela looks somewhat lifelike real clearly software around quite time relatively popular also think recent hacker lilmiquela page another model dazd site seriousness lilmiquela model used site mad props creator cause heshe talented probably laughing theories behind followers

11ew2bm,Replacing Mascots With Virtual Influencers,xb it’s hard to imagine some brands without their iconic mascots for example geico has martin the gecko frosted flakes has tony the tiger and microsoft office had clippy the paperclip these virtual characters are designed to help sell experiences related to the purchase of goods and services and they have become an essential part of advertising marketing and community engagement the use of these intellectual property ip characters is a longstanding tradition in the marketing space they have appeared in everything from print ads to television commercials and they have even starred in their own video games for instance kfc’s romance simulator “i love you colonel sanders” was a unique marketing product that challenged brands to think outside the box overall mascots have proven to be effective tools in building brand awareness customer loyalty and engagement by creating a memorable character a brand can establish a connection with consumers that goes beyond the product or service itself it’s no wonder that many companies continue to use mascots as part of their marketing strategies xb the influencer generation around social media became the new baseline for marketing with it a new kind of promoter called the “influencer” evolved from people doing everyday things or sharing their love of a subject resulting in amassing large audiences ordinary people were elevated to celebrity status by building their own identities on social media brands took notice of this and wanted to leverage those communities in which influencers had built a more personal and trustworthy relationship than simply trying to sell them products the problem with influencers is that they often aren’t managed properties like mascots if an influencer is caught doing or saying something negative it could result in them being canceled if a spokesperson or influencer for a brand is canceled it will most likely have a negative effect on the company that hired them so how can you limit the odds of working with an influencer you can work with a virtual influencer instead virtual influencers are computergenerated characters that can represent a brand and provide a more controlled and consistent image than human influencers virtual influencers don’t have the potential for negative behavior that human influencers do and they can be fully managed and controlled by the brand this approach can help brands to avoid the risks associated with human influencers and still benefit from the power of social media marketing as social media continues to evolve it’s likely that we will see more brands turning to virtual influencers to help them build and maintain their online presence xb source codemiko youtube the next generation of the mascot is here… the vinfluencer with the advancement of technology comes the innovation of storytelling brands are nothing more than a company with great storytelling and unified imagery if we were to create a modernday mascot it would definitely be the virtual influencer or “vinfluencer” or “vtuber” if on youtube the barrier to entry to create a d avatar has never been lower with unreal engine’s metahumans you can create a nearly realistic avatar all you need is an actor looking into an iphone and voila you have a virtual influencer of course it’s not quite that easy but it feels like it sometimes it does require a minimal level of technical knowledge to bring one of these virtual beings to life and many people do it as a fulltime job streaming on twitch or youtube the rise of virtual influencers is a testament to the power of storytelling and branding a virtual influencer can provide a more controlled and consistent image than human influencers and they can also avoid the risks associated with human behavior as technology continues to evolve we can expect to see more and more brands turning to virtual influencers as a way to engage with their audiences and build their online presence some great virtual influencers to watch codemiko xanadu lil miquela barbie barbie guggimon some general rules for building your own virtual influencer as many companies or brands decide to create their own virtual influencers it’s important to design them specifically for their audience while keeping in mind the image of the company otherwise the character could be seen as problematic like what happened with the kansas city chiefs here are some common sense rules for creating your virtual influencer the vinfluencer must be a representation of the company itself and not the image they want to portray for example if your company isn’t owned by a majority of people of color then your virtual influencer should be white if your company boardroom is mostly black then don’t have a vtuber who is asian and so on do not use an actor who is not the same racegender as your vinfluencer unless it is anthropomorphic also don’t make your actor do accents that aren’t their own for the character develop a meaningful past and dive deep into a welldeveloped character personality where is your vinfluencer from what is their education level what is their family life like what are they afraid of there are many details that can be developed in the next section titled “character tree” it’s okay to have a nonhuman vinfluencer but make sure the previous rules are followed for racial “coded” traits a good example is fry from aqua teen hunger force where he is obviously coded as a black man but is in the body of a floating container of fries by following these rules you can create

jd0qua,"Agency: Does Paris Hilton have Agency? Does Lil Miquela have Agency? Who is human, who is robot? Where is the line?",after a watch of the new paris hilton documentary my friends and i had a debrief on the video we walked away from the one hour minute documentaryfilm with an understanding of paris to be a more dimensional figure than her social media presence would otherwise suggest but that debrief is for another forum the quandary we find ourselves in and for this tangent of the conversation is centered on the concept of agency our conversation also quickly integrated the example of lil miquela to the forefront of the discourse lil miquela an instagram cgi influencer a model featured in campaigns for major high fashion brands such as prada and calvin klein an icon who celebrities clamor to pose with on her instagram page and her content is known for being always exactly with the trends one of the friends in this discussion took a class at our undergrad institution in the science in societies program titled imitations of life this class is described to be the examination of the scientific and cultural practices of corporeal simulation or practices of bodily substitution imitation and remodeling special attention will be paid to the relationship between scientific discourses of universality and particularity where sociocultural forms of difference eg race gender disability etc are at once ignored and exacerbated the remainder of the course description can be found here the discussion of agency and paris was debated wholeheartedly for the night many side examples were introduced our undergrad collection of knowledge a collective accumulation of years in the liberal arts was put to the test and all with this class for fodder for the mind we analyzed poked at these two examples and wrestled endlessly with the concept agency as the night came to a close and the conservation had to taper to a natural pausepoint for the evening and we found ourselves left chewing on one final question where is the edge of the looking glass between paris hilton and lil miquela two social media icons blue check certified million followers for lil miquela million for paris both international icons both for their modelingsocial media presences as well as for their contributions to the djdigital music scene one built upon endless effort time and energy poured into the social media sphere a space to shape perfect and craft her image paris averaging hours and minutes a day devoted to her image capturing her reality through the lens of her phone and transmitting to the digital world this is paris official documentary tipod the other a digital projection created by a dj producerdirector and a young forbes under tech magician she is fabricated from the creativity and compsci craftsmanship of these two contrasting collaborating comrades she is an illusion projecting the image of reality relatability and in an essence humanity lil miquela full name miquela sousa a yearold los angelesbased half brazilian and half spanish avatar she maintains a very active social media presence and portrays a personal and notably honest depiction of vulnerability with her posts miquela actively engages and comments on current events and social movements she posts celebrating not shaving her armpit hair encourages young people to vote and shares a photo of her kissing bella hadid sharing her sexual identity with the world lil miquela is incredibly personable relatable and has marked a new era in ai dubbed by some as a genius marketing initiative while younger users look up to the figure trevor mcfedries sara decou bof while one is human and projecting artificiality the other is artificial and projecting humanity both are leaning against the glass that projects what they both are striving to obtain…and what that is im not too certain of like authenticity maybee its a fascinating parallel between these two and usually in parallels you can learn a lot about them both as individuals by looking at them both in relation to each other as literary foils of one another lil miquela is undeniably fabricated though the pixels in the screens we view her on and is striving to be relatable authentic and so authentic we must consider is she human if she is human does she have thoughts preferences sentience perhaps and we know paris is undeniably human and her posts display her striving to project this flawless image a fabricated image filtered posed modeled and in her own words while reflecting on her life it’s like a cartoon tipod her daytoday navigation of the world can feel so stiff so posed so rigidly on brand that it seems at times she embodies and becomes the virtual projection of herself does paris then inch herself closer to the artificial side of the reality vs artificiality spectrum closer to lil miquelas side with all her media activity structuring her life about it and committing her energy towards producing it paris is far closer to the digital realm than the average human miquela is closer to the human realm than the average ai certainly closer than those foot automated vacuums that cruise around large supermarkets but i digress both trapped on their respective sides of the spectrum the screen acting the barrier between those two realms miquela inside paris outside both pressing up against the tempered glass so where is the line of the looking glass will paris ever be fully frozen in the digital land become a fully embodied projection of the filters fueled by the support and likes of her followers which drive her business model the metrics and data the fans fuel her business her business being her image her image the embodiment of her brand does agency feel a little faded here will miquela ever step over the threshold that will gain her access to sentience to gain the ability to form independent opinions and to act on those subsequent decisions lil miquela didn’t announce to the public she was ai until two years after her account was active people were stunned with agency comes responsibility and this dredges up some major moralethical debates but again we will save these for another post… but what would alan turing have to say about this where and how are the mindbodyconsciousness divisions drawn here dualism vs monism how would descartes feel perhaps the impact lil miquela makes with her followers their love admiration and support for her can be the factor that tips the turning test to verify ones realness the blue check certification of realness instagram themselves define this verification process to be based on the completion of four criteria to be deemed authentic unique complete and notable found in tab three of the previous hyperlinked attachment and the idea of real leads to the linking of the idea of human which leads to the linking

fm3475,Where is the Body in Digital Rhetoric,intro to assigned reading there previously was a point in time where you had a choice if you would join the online movement today everyone has a virtual and a physical self and it is hard to separate the two reflections on reading a few things lunceford explained that stuck with me were his comments on his facebook profile “on my own facebook page there are many photos of me and my family and not one of them has been put there by me” p from how i interpreted it lunceford was referring to him being tagged in photos and it sparked a question in my head unless you refuse to take photographs for the rest of eternity is there really any way to keep your identity hidden in our social media era he explains that one’s identity is typically made up of race sexual orientation marital status religion ethnicity hobbies friends and if one has children without even seeing the photos you know they will answer the majority of these categories he did a great job explaining that other people can reveal your identity for you even if you don’t want to i think a strength in the piece was giving an example of a more drastic situation when aliaa amgda elhmahdy posted nude photographs to critique patriarchal values in egypt she received death and ended up being kidnapped because her virtual and physical presence intertwined since we have consistently talked about lilmiquela in class what if there was no physical presence in this situation what if aliaa used an animated nude female or a lilmiquela with the same hashtag would it still be effective in protest listing this drastic situation makes you think of alternative routes when your virtual presence can bring harm to your physical one other strength that stuck with me was the description between the body and spirit “the body or the flesh is regarded as the enemy of the spirit” p lunceford further described that the body can provide concerning traits that may be considered as undesirable in the physical world if you and others are completely anonymous online your digital personas allow people to come together it gives the idea that when you are anonymous online with others it is only your spirit and mind to have the purest form of conversation where if any personal traits are revealed about each other it can prevent that which is where i think the quote derives from the body is the enemy of the spirit course connections it is also said that we can no longer completely separate the physical from the virtual they are no longer two separate realms when it comes to our class use of reddit if all of us picked usernames that didn’t hint at who we are and who was handling each assigned reading was anonymous it would be difficult to attach who is who reddit is probably one of the few sites where you are able to achieve that anonymity although you are more than welcome to link personal info with your account most people don’t if you ever stumble upon a serious message board most people openly admit to using a burner account for any personal post they don’t want any of their personal information being linked to their “physical body” they want to keep this strictly to their virtual self that is why reddit is the closest thing to those early chat boards lunceford mentions with an anonymous feel questions if reddit forced you to link your account with a personal facebook for example would it still be as popular in the piece “a declaration of the independence of cyberspace” is referenced it is described as a world where all may enter without privilege or prejudice in regard to race economic power and the list goes on with this being from is being anonymous still the purest form of communication with the evolution of trolling do you personally have any anonymous accounts for example i have a reddit that has of my personal info attached to it negroponte in argued that war will eventually make no sense because digital space will be more important than physical do you agree if so why current events when it comes to digital space being more important than physical not adding a specific link because there are tons of examples politicians are currently fighting for digital space on your timeline on social media now i wouldn’t say one is more important than the other but politicians are trying to get reposted by pages with high follower counts to reach their digital followers in regard to the portion when the body online is connected with a body in the physical world i see it relating to current day nba with the coronavirus the los angeles lakers and philadelphia ers are announcing the amount of people on the team that have tested positive but not revealing specifically who i view it as the teams protecting the names not wanting to attach a “physical body” preventing the players from being heckled on their online presence i say this because for example kevin durant tested positive and hours later memes making jokes out of it were already circulating,intro assigned reading previously point time choice would join online movement today everyone virtual physical self hard separate two reflections reading things lunceford explained stuck comments facebook profile facebook page many photos family one put interpreted lunceford referring tagged photos sparked question head unless refuse take photographs rest eternity really way keep identity hidden social media era explains one identity typically made race sexual orientation marital status religion ethnicity hobbies friends one children

ax28mv,Please Share,okay this is my third time trying to type this up and its so frustrating im choosing to keep my identity a secret because yes i want people to read this and know about it but i also dont want people to know me im a regular person except i might be a bit different im always paying attention to new things or things in general i can never have enough information i pay attention to detail and ive come up with new ideas and crazy informative theories and i hope it will in courage you to do your own thinking and paying attention question everything because this is some real shit and these are only a couple things ive thought of okay so ai technology is already crazy enough i hope you guys have heard about the real life robot sofia she looks almost human but a little more plastic and they dont put hair on her so you cant confuse her for human but i question why she doesnt look more realistic i mean it would make her scarier but it seems like something that should be done you know since science is heading that way anyway because think about this celebrity wax figures look real as hell i have personally been to one of the museums so if they can make those figures look real why cant they do that to sofia my theory is that there are already robots just like us we cant tell it apart sofia is just something that is subliminally getting us used to the idea and maybe the wax figures are just old robot celebrity skins or clones or have you heard of the instagram star lilmiquela i think she might actually just be an entire robot and theyre still trying to fix her body more and i think she might be a robotic pop star in an interview with conspiracy theorist shane dawson she was ask who she was and she was just like im me and thats kind of how some of our small ai machines dodge our questions i think its something for the future next theory tiktok now i know damn well im not the only one tired of this shit so i started thinking where the fuck did this shit come from i think its meant to manipulate children half of the videos i get ads for the person in the video has their mouth moving to something else while the song is playing one thing i saw one ad where the girl was doing a symbol and sometime a song or tune will be high pitched i guess for the sound to mind control or something of that theory for these next ones i just want to say that if this post blows up and they start to look for me for who i really am and they try to get rid of me i will have my family reveal my identity these are just theories and im not a racist but this has to do with the white race and other things and its kind of crazy bare with me i feel like the first ever people were actually brown colored not black but more like indian or hispanic color i think white people came later and they didnt want to be the wrong race you know so they had to be more superior now i dont know exactly when it all started but the white people made it to where nobody talked about how the colored people came first there is no way that the bible took place in the middle east with white people that should be obvious now im not sure if this is true but the book of enoch was removed from the bible because white people didnt want other races to read it and think that white people were bad now you might think why would that book make us think that thats because enoch had a son who had a son which was noah and noah was an albino or the first person to be born with white skin now in the book it was said that everyone thought he was the son of an angel that the angels were having children on earth now maybe this could tie in with greek gods and demigods or maybe this could mean that white people were created by the fallen angels the ones that chose to fallow satan and were cast down to earth noah was described as white and red and check this out black or brown people can be in the sun yeah our skin peels sometimes or we get tanned but we dont turn red white people turn red and you know what else is red demons the devil and from personal experience i do believe in god and the bible but there is twisted shit going on with the information and i used to be a type of buddhist where i was at peace with the earth and universe and i loved plants and nature and good energy i didnt really have a religion for it thats just how i felt and i was happy like that when i first started believing in god i was happy but now im finding myself becoming depressed again anyway i brought that up to bring up america and how the native americans were here first then the white men came now of course we have learned in school that native americans believed in spirits and energy and they used plants and herbs as medication and they survived like that for years but the white men came at hey wanted to be better and they saw how happy these little indian people were and went uo to them and said something like oh you have all these gods well we have one god and hes better than all of your gods combine and if you dont believe in him then hell kill you or something like that and its really fucked up because the white men took the native americans daughters and raped them

aowwno,When do you personally think 3D renderings will overtake humans when it comes to social media / marketing?,the question is not if but when human d renderings are not yet where they need to be in order to make human models nervous but theyre close just take a look at probably the most well known social media rendering miquela to see what i am talking about xb also i am not saying that we will have no need for human models there will most likely be some work for humans for the next years but when do you think a major portion of the total number of annual modeling jobs are given to cgi artists rather than actual humans,question human renderings yet need order make human models nervous theyre close take look probably well known social media rendering miquela see talking xb also saying need human models likely work humans next years think major portion total number annual modeling jobs given cgi artists rather actual humans

7glck2,Lil Miquela like tulpa account idea,this idea popped into my head as i was thinking about what my future with embers may look like and for some reason miquela popped into my head im mainly writing down this so i dont forget this idea if you dont who lil miquela she has a instagram that has pictures of her thing is that she is the d model imposed on to the photos so my thinking is couldnt you do something similar for a tulpas social medias account if they wanted to of course the facial expressions might be hard to get right for human looking tulpas but other than that it sounds doable note if this idea is dumb i blame it on the fact its am when writing,idea popped head thinking future embers may look like reason miquela popped head im mainly writing dont forget idea dont lil miquela instagram pictures thing model imposed photos thinking couldnt something similar tulpas social medias account wanted course facial expressions might hard get right human looking tulpas sounds doable note idea dumb blame fact writing

c268x4,I work for a celebrity that doesn't exist.,i work for a very highprofile celebrity i cant tell you who at the risk of my life but i can tell you this she as you know her does not exist we come in at am the whole committee has never even met her despite the fact weve worked here four years marge claims she glimpsed her once going into our building but the rest of us dont believe her she has better things to do than deal with us social media comes first annabelle drafts up a tweet could be anything but usually its a downtoearth joke or vague political commentary then we send it to our focus group girls in age thats my job as resident numbercruncher i analyze the results and decide if its worthy of posting if it isnt we start over if we need it to be personal we take a photo of rebecca from behind shes the only blonde in the group and is a good standin for the real thing if they want a cute pet photo we take a photo of bens dogs the fans have never noticed in fact every detail of her life that makes it to the public relationships feuds even scandals that are leaked are all carefully manufactured and curated i dont think shes even met up with her serious boyfriend of three years other than to get purposefully caught by the paparazzi it all went to shit when marge decided she wanted to meet her im going to do it she told us grinning ear to ear im going to meet her how ben asked why i asked because i have a theory she pulled out her phone tapped a few times look at this photo from her concert in september look at her ears okay i said what about them shes got huge earlobes right but in this photo she yanked her phone back and swiped a few times shes got cute little connected earlobes all of us stared at her its not the same person what rebecca asked its different people if you take a closer look the noses are different too just slightly and think about it it would be easy to turn any skinny blonde girl into her what we think of as her face is really just makeup the dark lipstick the false eyelashes all the contouring as she spoke marges voice became more manic more frenzied what next marge a tinfoil hat ben asked arms crossed against his chest a few murmured in agreement she ignored them and continued emphatically i think its not just her perception her persona thats fake i think redacted doesnt exist then who sings her songs annabelle asked through smacks of chewing gum some nameless faceless employee paid bucks an hour yeah but shes met fans ben said one of her doppelgangers has met fans marge corrected but look im going to try and meet her okay im not here so you can talk me out of it she glanced around the room a smile on her face im here to ask who wants to come with me i will marge turned to me and smiled oclock tonight then my place the plan was to drive to redacteds address this wasnt the address that made it into all the magazines the tabloids it was the address listed on our paychecks and the organization itself we got there in under minutes it was a country estate on the outskirts of the city we parked half a mile down the street wear this marge said passing me a black wool cap thats when reality sunk in we could be arrested for this couldnt we not really were not breaking in were just taking a look my heart pounded as i pulled the hat over my hair we slunk out into the darkness keeping low as we walked along the side of the street her mansion loomed into view white pillars bay windows marble statues peeked through the hedges in the backyard the quiet splashes of a fountain echoed from somewhere unseen no lights were on in the house shes probably out i said or she doesnt exist marge replied we crept around the corner to the side of the house thats when we saw one light was on on the second floor golden light spilled out into the grass someones up there marge said maybe we should get out of here no im going to see who it is marge ran over to a nearby tree she climbed fast with more agility than any yearold woman should possess then she stretched her neck and the golden light washed over her face her eyes widened oh my god marge she didnt reply i climbed up onto one of the rocks with a deep breath i jumped i only saw it for a second a flash of the image like a photograph a still lifeless body lay across a bed she looked just like redacted a man bent over her holding a knife the whole scene lit in the soft golden glow of the lamps my heart thundered in my chest i jumped again no it wasnt a knife it was a soldering iron and now he was staring straight at us i opened my mouth to call to marge but it was too late crack a shot thundered through the air from the forest marge dropped out of the tree her body hit the ground with a sickening thump shot right in the forehead i ran i ran as fast as i could away from the house down the street i didnt stop until i got to the car panting like mad i called even though i knew marge was beyond saving what is your emergency my friend was just shot please send someone out here where are you now redacted willow street silence from the other line then her voice cut through the speaker curt and crisp im sorry we cant find that address click i stared in disbelief at my phone the next morning the news said that marge had committed suicide alone in her apartment but i know the truth,work highprofile celebrity cant tell risk life tell know exist come whole committee never even met despite fact weve worked four years marge claims glimpsed going building rest us dont believe better things deal us social media comes first annabelle

16zalap,what are your thoughts on the allegations against lil tay’s parents?,,
bn08kw,MAJOR conspiracy theory on Kanye West and Chicago West,major fucking disclaimer i know this is totally out there probably false but hey were here for shits and giggles so hear me out im going to organize this so i dont sound totally crazy lol xb what fueled this theory observing chicago in every situation this baby is emotionless barely makes a sound and is overall just a doll shes perfect shes adorable shes borderline flawless subjectively a dollyou say hmm hang on there xb the theory chicago west is actually an ai robot doll created by donda kanyes company this really wont make sense unless you read the explanation below skip key points and key dates if youre crunched for time but its worth the info xb key points to know before i dive in on the explanation if youre a real kanye fan you know that kanye had this vision of making donda again the company not his mother this mothership of all things essential to mankind he wanted the company to have branches in design furniture home architecture fashion music tech etc etcbasically everything that was his huge vision with donda many many years ago as kanye dabbled in fashion he was rejected he was also initially rejected from being a rapper but we all know how that played out anyway eventually kanye got somewhat respect in fashion now tech remember when around tlop kanye was tweeting apple and mark asking for money and for them to collaborate with him he pretty much was ridiculed and also shut down no one really took him seriously this was also when kanye tweeted he was i think million in debt i think between yeezus and tlop kanyes public persona and his overall mental wellbeing declined a lot he was desperate to fit into tech was desperate for money and funding and also on the brink of his mental tipping point which happened soon into the saint pablo tour kim k had a difficult pregnancy with north after north she had a hard time getting pregnant with saint and this was a risky pregnancy after saint her doctors basically informed her that her body was shut down and she could not have more babies physically im sure kim knew even before saint that saint would be the last child she could carry without it really affecting her health kanye west loves his wife theres no denying of that hed do anything for her kim always wanted a big family also not a surprise kim had chicago via surrogate shes also having a th baby via surrogate xb some key dates tlop and crazy tweets million debt etc came out feb saint west was born dec chicago west born jan xb jump to here if youre crunched for time but i suggest reading all of it the explanation the entire surrogate concept is a total fake story and in reality kanyes company donda is working heavily in ai research to create babies because kanye saw how sad kim was after she was informed she could not physically have any more children kanye went into millions of in debt trying to make this technology work he not only wanted to do it for his wife but he wanted to incorporate all of the goals of donda and make his own dreams come true he would be incorporating tech design and real life making life better type of thing by being able to provide families who cant have children their own perfect ideal baby chicago west is a result of this major experiment the lab is in chicago which is why kanye spends so much time there and the chicago baby is the first successful result of this entire project which is why her name is chicago kanye feels very emotionally attached to chicago because of his mother and now his first major successful lifechanging and lifecreating experiment ever notice in the vogue video how chicago does not like to be cuddled or held that much shes a robot shell break her expressionless and barely talking emotions contributes to this as well the chicago project yes i just named it this for convenience was fueled not only because of kanyes love for his wife but because was so angered by the lack of support he got in design and in tech he basically stuck his middle finger out to all these people went into debt got in a lab and got to work we can all agree kanye sort of lost it shortly before and majorly after the release of tlop this was also around the time of saint wests birth so he really got to work on this experiment during that time spend hours upon hours in a lab with robots and youd lose your shit too this also explains why his albums are delayed and he hasnt come out with any cool new products the new yeezys are just new colors and not really any new designs my friend told me this sounds a lot like the show west world sorta bc robots and ish so i wouldnt be surprised if kanye thought that was a calling for himcos west other family members dont give chicago that much attention because they know shes not really blood and is a robot unlike north and saint whos debuts were on ellen chicagos debut was in kylies pregnancy video about stormi it was like heres chicago okay bye they wanted to keep eyes off the baby until they were able to fine tune her application into a family xb xb anyway this is pretty the end of my lengthy theory if you made it this far congrats youre as crazy as i am xb xb xb edit kim tweeted that the new baby looks exactly like chicago i mean obviously since theyre from the same lab,major fucking disclaimer know totally probably false hey shits giggles hear im going organize dont sound totally crazy lol xb fueled theory observing chicago every situation baby emotionless barely makes sound overall doll shes perfect shes adorable shes borderline flawless subjectively dollyou say hmm hang xb theory chicago west actually ai robot doll created donda kanyes company really wont make sense unless read explanation skip key points key dates youre crunched time worth info xb key points know dive explanation youre real kanye fan know kanye vision making donda company mother mothership things essential mankind wanted company branches design furniture home architecture fashion music tech etc etcbasically everything huge vision donda many many years ago kanye dabbled fashion rejected also initially rejected rapper know played anyway eventually kanye got somewhat respect fashion tech remember around tlop kanye tweeting apple mark asking money collaborate pretty much ridiculed also shut one really took seriously also kanye tweeted think million debt think yeezus tlop kanyes public persona overall mental wellbeing declined lot desperate fit tech desperate money funding also brink mental tipping point happened soon saint pablo tour kim difficult pregnancy north north hard time getting pregnant saint risky pregnancy saint doctors basically informed body shut could babies physically im sure kim knew even saint saint would last child could carry without really affecting health kanye west loves wife theres denying hed anything kim always wanted big family also surprise kim chicago via surrogate shes also th baby via surrogate xb key dates tlop crazy tweets million debt etc came feb saint west born dec chicago west born jan xb jump youre crunched time suggest reading explanation entire surrogate concept total fake story reality kanyes company donda working heavily ai research create babies kanye saw sad kim informed could physically children kanye went millions debt trying make technology work wanted wife wanted incorporate goals donda make dreams come true would incorporating tech design real life making life better type thing able provide families cant children perfect ideal baby chicago west result major experiment lab chicago kanye spends much time chicago baby first successful result entire project name chicago kanye feels emotionally attached chicago mother first major successful lifechanging lifecreating experiment ever notice vogue video chicago like cuddled held much shes robot shell break expressionless barely talking emotions contributes well chicago project yes named convenience fueled kanyes love wife angered lack support got design tech basically stuck middle finger people went debt got lab got work agree kanye sort lost shortly majorly release tlop also around time saint wests birth really got work experiment time spend hours upon hours lab robots youd lose shit also explains albums delayed hasnt come cool new products new yeezys new colors really new designs friend told sounds

1lf9g6d,Sturmpanzer: why giving it only heat rounds would be a nerf,oh no another sturmpanzeralecto post anyways many people seem too be thinking intuitively that the heat round for the sturmpanzer is stronger imma go over its strengths but mostly its weakness the first thing to understand is that enlisted and warthunder share a mechanic called overpressure basically any round with explosive filler has an explosive penetration aspect seperate from the kineticcopper jet from say aphe and heat this explosive penetration works in a sphere from point of impact and if it meets any part of the tank that has less armor than the explosive penetration value it will overpressure the tank and kill every crew member within that compartment any open topped tank overpressures from any round with more than grams of tnt equivalent so the sturmpanzer he shell has mm of explosive penetration this means that it will be able to easily pen every tank in the game just by shooting the lower half of its turret in br and and through the hull on any tank in br and below the only exceptions to this rule are any kv or is tank kv tanks you’ll have to aim a little lower on the turret and can’t hull pen and is tanks you’ll have to hit the cupula the heat round has mm of normal pen and mm of explosive pen this means while it can more effectively deal with kv tanks and is tanks but loses out the ability to overpressure the t hull and is less reliable against sherman’s heat will also do less damage than say aphe but the round is big enough where it still will do pretty well now how about their anti infantry capability to put as a good standard the kv has fragments and meter radius the he shell on the sturmpanzer has fragments with a whopping meter radius that’s a percent radius increase meanwhile the heat round has fragments with a meter radius much more reasonable tldr heat only rlly helps against kv and is tho he can still work but is less reliable of a killer against any other tank and has he performance much more in line with the br the sturmpanzer is at,oh another sturmpanzeralecto post anyways many people seem thinking intuitively heat round sturmpanzer stronger imma go strengths mostly weakness first thing understand enlisted warthunder share mechanic called overpressure basically round explosive filler explosive penetration aspect seperate kineticcopper jet say aphe heat explosive penetration works sphere point impact meets part tank less armor explosive penetration value overpressure tank kill every crew member within compartment open topped tank overpressures round grams tnt equivalent sturmpanzer shell mm explosive penetration means able easily pen every tank game shooting lower half turret br hull tank br exceptions rule kv tank kv tanks aim little lower turret hull pen tanks hit cupula heat round mm normal pen mm explosive pen means effectively deal kv tanks tanks loses ability overpressure hull less reliable sherman heat also less damage say aphe round big enough still pretty well anti infantry capability put good standard kv fragments meter radius shell sturmpanzer fragments whopping meter radius percent radius increase meanwhile heat round fragments meter radius much reasonable tldr heat rlly helps kv tho still work less reliable killer tank performance much line br sturmpanzer

1jimshx,CHAPTER 7; Rust town,when the locals said that rust town was walled off they weren’t kidding as he drove as north as possible ryan began to see the fortifications separating the district from the rest of new rome they weren’t so much walls as a mix of tall steel cylinders wired fences mounted cameras and surveillance systems trained genomes occupying watchtowers pushed back clouds of pollution away from the touristic areas and into rust town with wind manipulation so rich people wouldn’t breathe the same air as the lower classes since they all seemed to produce currents of air ryan assumed they used the knockoff elixir marketed as ‘tempest’ that gave its user minor aerokinesis as he drove around the fortress in search of an entrance point the genome put on dynamis radio listening to the news “—we received confirmation that the explosion in little maghreb yesterday was the result of a short duel between our beloved protector wyvern and the criminal genome known as vulcan” ryan immediately raised the volume “vulcan formerly known as urban guerilla briefly served as wyvern’s sidekick before joining the criminal syndicate known as the augusti reports indicate vulcan was forced to flee after causing great collateral—” oh so that was why vulcan didn’t contact him this time little maghreb was probably close to the augusti’s hideout and he—or she ryan didn’t remember—decided to ambush wyvern when the opportunity presented itself they probably took heavy wounds and ryan fell off their radar afterward would the courier have to change hotels again no better to stay in the first hotel until wyvern contacted him and then switch places to avoid the assassination attempt that ended the last loop “—the psycho cryokinetic known as ghoul attempted to escape containment by the private security early yesterday but was quickly recaptured by il migliore” the radio continued “enrique manada manager of the superhero team stated that ‘as long as dynamis remains strong warlords and madmen will never gain a foothold in new rome’” at least warning wyvern did make a difference she probably relayed his tip about the private security being compromised to her team who intervened in time then again it must have been hard for ghoul to run away without his legs ryan eventually reached a border checkpoint guarded by three private security guards all of them carried riot gear and laser rifles their chief made ryan a sign to stop and the genome did his best to look innocent it was pretty hard with the mask and full quicksave attire but it was the attitude that counted “halt” the guard said “no entry without proper authorization or work permit” “i’m just visiting” ryan said “i heard they have a zoo” “it is a zoo” the guard grumbled “look citizen this is the frontier of civilization beyond is the untamed urban wilderness and we’re the only people standing between new rome and the hordes of barbarians who would tear it down” “well when i see you i do fear for civilization” “you should” the man replied missing the obvious sarcasm “so if you want to pass with proper authorization you will have to contribute to our community’s mutual defense” “sure” ryan replied “you aren’t going to check my car for drugs weapons or anything dubious i swear i’m clean as the day i was born” “depends on how much you contribute to the community” no wonder that the augusti and meta could get in and out so easily since the guards weren’t even trying to hide their corruption they probably had very few surprise inspections the second he passed the checkpoint ryan understood why they called it rust town first and foremost the air quality dropped drastically even worse than the harbor the smell of rust and chemicals was so pervasive the courier wondered if someone dumped toxic waste out in the open ryan had to raise his car’s windows and activate his mask’s air filter just to make it bearable almost every house and threefloor apartment buildings had fallen into a state of disrepair windows were broken cinder block walls were covered in graffiti some even crumbling the neighborhood was positively claustrophobic narrow streets forming a labyrinth of alleys almost too small for his car to move in fire escapes casting them in shadow in spite of the daylight streetlights didn’t work well and a thick layer of smog colored the world in sickly yellow every piece of metal seemed to rust probably due to the pollution even ryan who had seen it all felt appalled by the locals’ living conditions squatters had overtaken everything dealers openly peddled bliss to homeless people and the locals avoided ryan’s gaze when he looked at them they all wore scarfs face masks or other protections against the gas even the children at one point the driver drove past a corpse left to rot in muddy waters due to an overflowing sewer entrance a pack of wild dogs waited nearby next to a pile of trash perhaps waiting for ryan to leave to feed ryan had made jokes about everything but he couldn’t muster the energy for humor today seeing a dealer who didn’t avert his gaze he lowered his window to ask where he could find geniusmade tech the local gave the directions for a place called paulie’s shop although not before trying to sell ryan a gram of bliss for an outrageous sum it appeared prices had gone up since the meta started hitting the local dealers’ suppliers ryan didn’t have any trouble finding paulie’s shop mainly because he had garish neon lights on his establishment’s sign although the man could have chosen a wider deadend alley for his establishment the genome parked his car in front of the door grabbed his coil gun just in case and then walked in “here’s johnny” ryan shouted opening the door without knocking the shop could be more aptly described as a disorganized garage with shelves made of accumulated junk it was a true and poorlyventilated wilderness of tools scavenged car parts hung from the ceiling and bulbs provided as little light as possible the man behind the counter was a scrawny balding little man in his forties halffrench halfbritish ryan could identify these strange creatures on sight in response to his unforgettable entrance the shopkeeper had immediately raised a rocket launcher at his client probably scavenged genius tech from the design “you…” a flash of recognition flashed in paulie’s eyes behind his goggles “it’s you” “yes me” ryan was so happy he had become so famous people recognized him on sight “are you one of my fans i knew i had a few” “a fan” the shopkeeper almost choked aiming the weapon at quicksave’s face “you maniac you destroyed my old workshop in otranto” “i did that” ryan asked confused when “two years ago you crashed a plane on it and then you gave me a letter” paulie snarled “you had been hired to deliver my mail and you said you wanted to make an ‘unforgettable entrance’” well it did sound like something he would do ryan observed the man with attention and he seemed vaguely familiar but… … no nope nothing “maybe” quicksave shrugged his shoulders “you don’t remember” paulie asked astonished “well you clearly took it more personally than i ever did” when he realized the poor man may have been forced to live in this dump because of him ryan instantly regretted his joke “sorry maybe i can pay you back for the bother” the shopkeeper ground his teeth in rage apparently he didn’t want ryan’s money “get the hell out of my shop before i pull the trigger” “you know i can stop time right” “it’s a facehugger missile” the man replied “once it’s locked the nanomissile keeps pursuing the target until it’s dead” what a way to start a business relationship normally the courier would have taken the hint and left the shopkeeper alone but he had a mission to fulfill his coil gun lowered in one hand ryan searched in his coat ignoring paulie’s weapon he brought out the plushie at the sight of this white beautiful rabbit plushie paulie’s face lost all colors “you know what this is” ryan said wagging his ultimate weapon at the shopkeeper “if you don’t lower your weapon i’m going to press the on button” “we’re in an enclosed space and you can’t control it” “neither can you” ryan raised his thumb preparing to activate the switch on his wmd’s back “i’ll do it” “don’t do it” paulie threatened to pull his weapon’s trigger “imma do it” the pressure in the room grew paulie shaking until his nerves gave away “fuck” he said dropping his weapon on the counter “how could you do that to a plushie the most adorable thing and you turned it into… into…” “it sounded like a good idea at the time” quicksave argued putting the plushie back in his coat for everyone’s safety “i’m looking for homemade genius tech” “ah i can’t help” paulie laughed happy to be as useless to ryan as possible “you couldn’t have picked a worse moment the junkyard is closed nobody sells anything” “i’m not looking to buy” ryan replied glancing at the establishment with disappointment even the weapon paulie wielded was shoddy and ready to crumble after firing a shot “i’m looking for a very specific technology bathyspheres used to make supply runs in the water crimsonpaint steampunk influence” “like len’s tech” paulie jumped back startled as ryan closed the gap between the counter and himself in the blink of an eye “paulie paulie paulie” the genome all but purred “do you want to be my friend” “no” the shopkeeper replied bluntly “then tell me everything” the shopkeeper let out a sigh of disgust “black hair blue eyes a bit crazy” “it’s called marxismleninism but yes” ryan replied more and more excited “that’s the same girl then she arrived in rust town six months ago calling herself the underdiver” ryan never heard of that nickname to his disappointment quicksave and the underdiver didn’t sound well as a comedic duo maybe qu the undersavers “just one of the geniuses trying to do business without dynamis or augustus recruiting them see what i mean there used to be a big black market here for genomes like her who don’t have enough resources to be selfsufficient but wanted to remain independent from big groups” ryan nodded silent and entirely focused on the shopkeeper the rapturous attention seemed to disturb paulie but it only encouraged him to speak faster “anyway she had managed to make herself an armor from scavenged stuff it looked like an old world jim diving suit she kept asking me for parts to maintain it so we met often” “did it have a minigun” ryan asked paulie made a strange face “how do you know that” because he knew her perfectly “please continue” “anyway she sold some of her inventions to the augusti to make end’s meet you must know that she was… very passionate” ryan nodded knowingly “she ended up attacking a chemical plant owned by dynamis to protest about the working conditions there” that was len alright always with that strange almost cute sense of justice obsessive desire to protect the weak and hatred of private ownership “and then what happened” “what happened guess what happened the private security attacked her workshop and caught her i heard rumors that the augusti broke her out but nothing from her afterward she vanished” this confirmed that the augusti were likely the one true path to len and should be favored although… the fact the private security captured her means they probably had a file on her still that was more information he had learned since since forever ryan was in a good mood an exceptional mood “for this information paulie” he decided on a whim “i shall grant you a wish” “grant me a wish” the shopkeeper frowned in disdain “you think you’re robin williams” finally a man of culture in this dissolute city “of course not i can only grant one wish not three” paulie prepared to blow him off before marking a short pause a thought crossed his mind “you aren’t kidding you are serious” “whatever it is i’ll fulfill it” no matter how many tries quicksave always honored his word “mmm… what do i have to lose nobody else will do anything about it” paulie put his hands on the counter joining his fingers “you know a psycho gang moved into rust town recently the metagang” “you want me to tarantino them” he nodded in confirmation “they’ve taken over the junkyard where most exchanges take place a few days ago and then things got worse they get worse every day the genomes they kill ‘em and drain their blood the normies they abduct straight off the street i don’t know what the psychos do with them but you don’t see them again” paulie clenched his teeth “even kids have gone missing” a chill went down ryan’s spine and his heart hardened as he had told zanbato kids were sacred for him especially since he got along with them better than adults and he had had a crappy childhood himself “does the private security know” “they know they just don’t care private security only protects key infrastructure like the power plant or the water treatment station which i have to admit they do zealously the rest are just frontier guards who couldn’t care less about what happens within the walls” paulie sneered in disgust “they don’t give a shit if a few homeless junkies and lowlifes go missing the psychos are doing them a favor cleaning out their glitzy city’s trash” “what about wyvern and il migliore” “wyvern gets in a fight with a lone meta sometimes” paulie admitted “but she’s the only one who cares and she can’t be everywhere until the meta kill too many workers assault tourists or steal an elixir shipment dynamis won’t lift a damn finger—” “wait” ryan interrupted him “the meta have been here for days and they haven’t attacked dynamis’ elixir shipments or genomes” paulie shook his head “that’s odd” the genome pointed out “psychos don’t act like that they usually make a mess of themselves trying to get knockoff elixirs to feed their addiction things escalate with locals and then they go on a rampage it’s always the same pattern” he should know he had lived with one and yet these psychos were awfully restrained by their kind’s standards come to think of it from what he had heard the meta hadn’t attacked dynamis’ infrastructures at all they only tried to drive the augusti out of rust town the reason was easy to guess dynamis couldn’t care less about the area unless its buildings or agents were attacked if ignored they wouldn’t lift a finger ryan had thought the metagang had come to new rome to fuel its addiction but clearly something else was at work unfortunately for paulie len was ryan’s only priority for now but he would honor his word no matter what it took “i will fulfill your wish in my perfect run” the genome promised “i swear” “your perfect run you’re jogging” “it’s the perfect ending” ryan explained it was a concept he had developed over his endless wandering if he gathered every piece of information possible about a given place and inhabitants through his loops then he could create the optimal situation he would then dedicate his last loop to creating the perfect chain of events which guaranteed the best outcome by his standards then and only then would ryan create a new save point and move on after learning where to go to reach the junkyard from its occupant ryan left paulie’s shop through the door and prepared to drive straight into the meta’s nest but then a bug landed on his plymouth flattening it ryan froze as an enormous three meters tall monster crashed on his car crushing the roof destroying the window and shattering the engine the creature looked like a twisted fusion between a human and a mosquito a monstrous insect with a black exoskeleton and crimson flesh beneath its eyes set on quicksave with hunger his claws raised “i knew” the mosquito rasped his voice closer to an insect’s buzzing than a man’s words “i smelled a rat sneaking i—” “my car” ryan screamed in horror his sudden wail startling the psycho the courier immediately stopped time rushing to his plymouth fury and checking on its health could he save it could he save it no the damage was too extensive ryan was overwhelmed with fury and quickly considered going on a kill bill rampage first against the mosquito then every psycho he could find he would show them the terror of hell unending a curse straight out of tartarus but… ryan couldn’t bear to live without his beloved plymouth with a depressed sigh the courier grabbed a small metal sphere from his coat and let time resume “you see this” he raised the sphere at the psycho “you see this” “what is this a ball—” “now look at my car which you destroyed then back to the ball it’s an abomb” click “now catch” ryan tossed the bomb at the mosquito who caught it with his hand due to sharp reflexes the psycho looked at the weapon then back at ryan confused and horrified “nobody touches my car” quicksave said nobody as rust town exploded in a burst of nuclear fire vaporizing the two superhumans with a flash of searing light ryan felt happy finally a new method he had never tried before,locals said rust town walled kidding drove north possible ryan began see fortifications separating district rest new rome much walls mix tall steel cylinders wired fences mounted cameras surveillance systems trained genomes occupying watchtowers pushed back clouds pollution away touristic areas rust town wind

1ep7smx,"The Case for Romaine Lettuce: The second most famous leaf eaten by Americans that is rich in the stuff you are low off (vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals) and poor in the stuff you are high off (sugar, calories, non-MUFA fats). A food for the rich and poor.",yes romaine lettuce is good for you no duh despite that shared understanding i intend to make the pressing case for its inclusion in your diet we all know its good to exercise everyday but how many of us actually do it but hey if theres somebody at your work who is cute who likes to workout boom well now maybe you have a reason to exercise everyday too we know things are good for us but sometimes just need the inspiration or motivation to actually act on it i plan on having you all going to the store to buy romaine at the end of this so sit down get a salad or a lettuce wrap or roll that leaf up in a jay and listen to what i say lettuce lactuca sativa l originates in the eastern mediterranean and grows well in the us where most is grown in ca yearround europe north africa and china there are several different types of lettuce with the three relevant ones being icebergcrisphead of us marketshare i give it a c on the nutrition scale its gonna be tough to get in to graduate school with that your transcript buddy romainecos a leaf a all lettuce is mostly water with iceberg being and romaine being water that difference of two percent is bigger than the difference between you and henry cavil in terms of looks jawline max bench press vomax net worth etc that allows for the packing of a tremendous more amount of bioactive compounds meaning compounds in this body that will be absorbed by your gi system and will interact with your bodys organs tissues cells enzymes dna everything all the food you eat is very much engaged in the most intimate of hugs with you if somebody is going to penetrate deep into you and youre going to takeabsorb their fluids you want it to be good preferably a longterm monogamous partner who loves and respects you but romaine lettuce will do too anyways yes that allows for a significant amount of more vitamins minerals polyphenols carotenoids and chlorophyll mainstream stuff vitamins and minerals a typical serving of romaine is grams which is calories of your daily calories in meals this can serve as a base similar to rice or bread and save your calories a meal with better micronutrients a romaine serving remember this is about of your daily calorie allotment will provide you an ftm femmeboy twink w attitude lets assume an adult male but if you are woman approximately multiply by will

ldl ldl is criminally charged due to its tendency to get trapped in the endothelium and contributes to atherosclerosis studies show that nonoxidized ldl does not get trapped in the endothelium you need antioxidants like phenolic compounds in your diet the key is oh group ros damage to proteinlipiddna directly causes impaired physiological function and contributes to the pathogenesis of stuff that is going to make getting older suck arthritis cancer atherosclerosis cardiomyopathy neurodegeneration diabetes and they literally are in a sense are what age you and your cells if you care about antiaging this what you need to focus on and not expensive skin creams mechanism note on absorptionbioavailablity phenolic compounds in natural food matrixes are very well absorbed directly digested bioaccessible in lower colon via your microbiome unable to be extracted from the food matrix however in lettuce many of the phenolic compounds exist in a glycosidic form which has increased absorption in the direct small intestine phase carotenoids are fat soluble and once released from the matrix gets incorporated with mixed micelles thus absorption is increased with other liposoluble things like cholesterol so please have some fat in your salad dressings because other components of the food matrix make it difficult for carotenoids to get extracted so you need help in conclusion lettuce has high nutritional value due to its contribution to dietary fiber several important dietary minerals various vitamins and bioactive compounds such as carotenoids phenolic compounds chlorophyll and even sesquiterpene lactones the bioavailability and metabolism of phytonutrients can better understand related health benefits and the ultimate delivery of these compounds especially due to its antioxidant compounds lettuce can provide some potential health benefits in cardioprotective anticancer antidiabetic and antiaging due to these potentials both in vitro and in vivo evidence verify the preclinical and clinical application of lettuce extracts which can be further investigated reading this article is what made me become a hype man for lettuce its also where most of my information is sourced and

you can your aid your baseline bodys natural cancer fighting immune system by reducing your oxidative stress load with lettuce and its phytonutrients because you get cancer every day technically but

1dhytg1,My overall positive personal analysis about BC as a first time user with Hashimoto's ,im sharing my very fresh review on bc in one collective post so i can help anyone that maybe has any hesitations overall my opinion is positive which many women dont share in the masses i struggle with hashimotos disease weight gain and difficulty to lose any grams of body weight even if im dieting for months and exercising on top of that i had notice the past tense a very psychological relationship with food like a mellowing substance i know many have experiences getting hangry shutting down dizziness trembling hands even non stop eating when stressed also i struggle with dysmenorrhea i have visited many gynecologist even changed between them because the lack of trust to see if my bad periods have a cause nothing as expected finally i have many depressive episodes that last for weeks or even months that are caused by my hashimotos i should notice that im engaged and i used the pull out method for years and years as a contraceptive my fiancé and i were talking about taking sex to the next step since we are grown people and having kids isnt the right step right now if ever for us after a visit with my endocrinologist we had a talk about bc mainly as a contraceptive to see if its the right move with my unstable hormones the doctor told me that it would be a good idea to get on it since i struggle with depression and dysmenorrhea and nothing really works i mean the only way i could get off my bed to go around the house because i was taking a day off from work the st and nd day of my period is having mg paracetamolmg ibuprofen every hours also consuming magnesium soothes cramps days before and the first days of my period with a combination of magnesium oil rubs around the area of my uterus constantly with a heating pad on me and a woolen scarf wrapped around my waist for extra heat taking stepsday for a whole month took my period cramps for a to a or on the pain scale dare i say its not a sustainable lifestyle at last he told me that i should talk with my gynecologist about it i was so skeptical for months because ive heard the worst about bc gain weight depression suicidal thoughts i really didnt want to add any of those to my body and psyche since im very sensitive with all of those symptoms after some time i finally talked with my gynecologist about getting on bc as a contraceptive and he told me that it will also help me with my dysmenorrhea pain length and heaviness of my period and with my acne yes in fact i get hormonal acne but i wouldnt say i suffer like others after some blood tests to make sure that bc wont harm me in any physical way i got on the pill the bc is a pill package with a break week no placebo pills in that week it is expected to get your withdrawal bleeding its different for everyone mine started on the th day of the week off i also made sure with my endocrinologist and my gynecologist that that specific brand is compatible with my hashimotos since i know some arent and make you way worse than where you started heres my positive outcome of all this my appetite changed for the best i dont get hαngry i dont associate food with emotions anymore theres no link between those its inexplicable i get full with of the portions i used to im not hungry all the time i enjoy life even with an empty stomach that was impossible before thus i lost kilos in a month without trying increased libido very selfexplanatory sex is amazing my fiancé enjoys sex even more and yes the reason i started it all im expecting no babies my skin is clear almost too clear i see every pose and scar ive created over the past years my period is way better imma be truthful its not unnoticeable but i only need paracetamolsh the first days and i still consume my magnesium like i used to far fewer pads theres no need for those night diaper like pads anymore i only change them for sanitary reason theres no need for heating pads and woolen scarfs either the camps when i get them they are a and most of the times i can walk them off that was a utopian scenario before no depressive episodes no suicidal thoughts not even untamed excess stress and anxiety theres peace behind those eyes at least for now heres my only negative symptom that i have so far mood swings especially the first week when i got on the pill and the week of the withdrawal bleeding if you have intense pms youd understand but its not that intense or that it last long at least for me im mostly fine and happy then something can make me very angry or very teary very fast but not for long maybe for minute max and then im back to normal overall i cannot recommend a literal hormonal drug like its a hairspray ad but i can share my positive journey since i rarely have heard a positive review about bc i can only recommend to every woman to pay a visit to an endocrinologist to check your hormones and i cannot recommend enough to find a good gynecologist even if it takes some tries and be comfortable to ask them all the questions,im sharing fresh review bc one collective post help anyone maybe hesitations overall opinion positive many women dont share masses struggle hashimotos disease weight gain difficulty lose grams body weight even im dieting months exercising top notice past tense psychological relationship food like mellowing substance know many experiences getting hangry shutting dizziness trembling hands even non stop eating stressed also struggle dysmenorrhea visited many gynecologist even changed lack trust see bad periods cause nothing expected finally many depressive episodes last weeks even months caused hashimotos notice im engaged used pull method years years contraceptive fiancé talking taking sex next step since grown people kids isnt right step right ever us visit endocrinologist talk bc mainly contraceptive see right move unstable hormones doctor told would good idea get since struggle depression dysmenorrhea nothing really works mean way could get bed go around house taking day work st nd day period mg paracetamolmg ibuprofen every hours also consuming magnesium soothes cramps days first days period combination magnesium oil rubs around area uterus constantly heating pad woolen scarf wrapped around waist extra heat taking stepsday whole month took period cramps pain scale dare say sustainable lifestyle last told talk gynecologist skeptical months ive heard worst bc gain weight depression suicidal thoughts really didnt want add body psyche since im sensitive symptoms time finally talked gynecologist getting bc contraceptive told also help dysmenorrhea pain length heaviness period acne yes fact get hormonal acne wouldnt say suffer like others blood tests make sure bc wont harm physical way got pill bc pill package break week placebo pills week expected get withdrawal bleeding different everyone mine started th day week also made sure endocrinologist gynecologist specific brand compatible hashimotos since know arent make way worse started heres positive outcome appetite changed best dont get hαngry dont associate food emotions anymore theres link inexplicable get full portions used im hungry time enjoy life even empty stomach impossible thus lost kilos month without trying increased libido selfexplanatory sex amazing fiancé enjoys sex even yes reason started im expecting babies skin clear almost clear see every pose scar ive created past years period way better imma truthful unnoticeable need paracetamolsh first days still consume magnesium

1cl7v8n,A new law: The Law of Choice,youve heard law of attraction law of assumption law of belief im thinking of coining the term law of choice as i think that could appeal to those critical of all the woowoo and blindfaith of these circles i got nothing to prove ill be completely honest i didnt do any marvel universe shit manifesting it improves my mental state sure it opened doors for me but i didnt wake up in hogwarts i didnt undo gram grams death i didnt win a bajillion dollars without even so much as buying a lottery ticket and i certainly didnt just religiously read neville goddard or joseph murphy ive read a lot of books a lot of existential philosophers sartre always being one of my favorites and his concept that mankind is burdened by choice and tries to pass the buck whenever possible in fact id say he contributes more to this than neville i made a post about what i did manifest and the neville group just deleted it i wasnt banned or anything because theyre not quite as psychotic as the murphy group but they did say thats not manifesting you just had a positive feedback loop on your psychology but isnt that the practical use of the law like the problem is you cant prove magic everyone you try you end up making a fool out of yourself thats why so many get trapped in as sartre put it bad faith not reddit bad faith of just saying things you dont like but bad faith of feeling like you have no choice that everything is set in its ways you always have a choice and will always be forced to make a choice and the more you accept this the more autonomy you gain i made a choice in a relationship and this person to me is everything i imagined in sp looks nothing like them i had to consider for a moment if i wanted too persist in my assumption and wait for magical fairy dust to make sp real or talk to a reallife person i chose the ladder ive done it before regrettably mind you a lot of bad exes but i did it with sincerity i did it not to run away from my loneliness and feeling bad i dont have sp but a genuine remorse and repentance i do love sp and i can love again i choose to be that loving person this seems closer to what neville meant by living in the end and being that version of yourself rather than using mindbeams to make exes come back or raise them from the dead with necromancy same thing with my money state ill be honest i whipped out the spiderman notebook for that one save me miles lol i let my inner child have some fun with it and now i have three interviews tomorrow imma be an exhausted bitch tomorrow and all three jobs have their strengths im going to have to seriously consider do i want the job i know ill love because it involves my hobbies it doesnt pay well and its kinda out of the way how ahout the lucrative job where ill make loads of money quickly but i know is probably gonna be stressful and theyll screw me what about the reliable job one i know is well unionized i can transfer no sweat and can easily get all the hours i need for cash problem is the job sucks but ive done it before with less wisdom and did okay these are legit choices i and only i can make and youre gonna have to make similar choices in your life but we forget that we think things will always be the same and they very well might be if you dont change your mindset but i didnt just visualize i applied for jobs i messaged that person yes i certainly wasnt expecting the bridge of events but its not magic its just life with self awareness in mind and im not even saying it isnt real i see synchronicities i think theres such a thing as too many coincidences and that our thoughts can shape our reality but in the same way if youre looking up porn dont be surprised when the website starts recognizing your fetish ya coomer lol and i dont wanna be a guru or something i want my own life and success i mean id certainly like to be an inspiration to others and help them do the things theyd like doing but i dont need their money or praise i got what i wanted not because i assumed it or believed it but because i chose it and choosing isnt easy it sounds easy but its scary its work its weird sometimes but thats why i think it reflects life in a more honest way than a lot of these other guys and i dont blame neville or joseph murphy themselves they aint alive for me to talk to them and ask them how theyd feel i have to choose for myself neville cant do it for me,youve heard law attraction law assumption law belief im thinking coining term law choice think could appeal critical woowoo blindfaith circles got nothing prove ill completely honest didnt marvel universe shit manifesting improves mental state sure opened doors didnt wake hogwarts didnt undo gram grams death didnt win bajillion dollars without even much buying lottery ticket certainly didnt religiously read neville goddard joseph murphy ive read lot books lot existential philosophers sartre always one favorites concept mankind burdened choice tries pass buck whenever possible fact id say contributes neville made post manifest neville group deleted wasnt banned anything theyre quite psychotic murphy group say thats manifesting positive feedback loop psychology isnt practical use law like problem cant prove magic everyone try end making fool thats many get trapped sartre put bad faith reddit bad faith saying things dont like bad faith feeling like choice everything set ways always choice always forced make choice accept autonomy gain made choice relationship person everything imagined sp looks nothing like consider moment wanted persist assumption wait magical fairy dust make sp real talk reallife person chose ladder ive done regrettably mind lot bad exes sincerity run away loneliness feeling bad dont sp genuine remorse repentance love sp love choose loving person seems closer neville meant living end version rather using mindbeams make exes come back raise dead necromancy thing money state ill honest whipped spiderman notebook one save miles lol let inner child fun three interviews tomorrow imma exhausted bitch tomorrow three jobs strengths im going seriously consider want job know ill love involves hobbies doesnt pay well kinda way ahout lucrative job ill make loads money quickly know probably gon na stressful theyll screw reliable job one know well unionized transfer sweat easily get hours need cash problem job sucks ive done less wisdom okay legit choices make youre gon na make similar choices life forget think things always well might dont change mindset didnt visualize applied jobs messaged person yes certainly

1c9mkjs,HOW I CONCURRED THE BAR EXAM - (LL.M/Anxious stress ball)  ,buckle up bitches here is everything i did to improve my performance and mentality to take me from in j mee mbe to in f mee mbe if there is anything else please ask i couldnt have done it without the help of this sub and am morally obligated to help out where i can overall studying started studying dec exam was feb as a retaker i think weeks was enough for j i started in early april which was overkill i think weeks is ideal pick a bar prep that will work with your schedule quimbee allowed me the flexibility to go in whatever order i wanted which was ideal i skipped uworld this time around because it was a repeat of what quimbee had i broke my studying down in three phases reintroduction period week learning round weeks learning round week drilling period weeks memorization period week spent the last week really focusing on weak areas learning round consisted of doing the quizzes on quimbee and taking note of the topics i was receiving less than on i would then watch the videos on the topic read the outline and write out the rules a couple of times until it was memorized learning round was reviewing my notes writing out my outlines redoing the quizzes practicing at least questions each topic along with at least mee on that topic drilling period was a complete focus on mbe since that was my weak spot i found every free material available online and used everything quimbee had to offer if i got a question wrong id write out the rule until it was memorized memorization period was really focusing on my outlines and making sure i knew the bll especially for mee id type out all my rules and outlines over and over again which not only helps with memorization but with typing speed learn the keywords quizlet is the best for this whenever i was bored or in the car churn out a couple flashcards really helped with mbe and mee for those buzzwords made sure to celebrate the small victories and protect my mental health reminded myself that panicking and being upset was just wasting my time and it was not being productive used this time as my revenge era unfollowed barexam about two weeks before the exam i love you all but some of your anxiety bleed through my screen and i couldnt have that again have to be okay with the fact that you will never learn all of the material learn as much as you can and be proud of it mee have to practice under timed conditions i started off with mins then went down to mins to really push my comfort zone and then finally went back to mins each that gave me a nice min buffer at the end which really saved my butt for mee the min period really helped with bullshitting rules under pressure before even reading mee go to the question figure out the topic you are working on and put it in the question box and underlinebold it ex undue influence underneath immediately put the issue ex at issue is whether carmen was unduly influenced by x key for organization key for helping grader and knowing the area of law kinda helps get the brain juices flowing for when you read the hypo i recommend against throwing down a rule before reading the hypo since you never really know what theyre wanting and in what context save your precious time i have to stay organized so after the underline title i make sure to copy and paste irac down the line id say this takes me about min for each question ok this was a game changer for me once the structure is done take every sentence bracket it and number it not only does it help you engage with the material better but then it allows you to create an outline with the numbered sentences which ensures you are using all the facts once youve used it cross the number off this was so helpful in staying organized takes about mins to read fully mark up and throw under each question which sentence belongs where when reviewing highlight in one colour what the rules were on the model answer and in another colour highlight what you used if there is no overlap write it down in a doc somewhere and add that to the list of rules you have to drill increase speed and accuracy was key ive always been a fast typer but anxiety makes my accuracy diminish which in turn takes longer was an amazing break when my brain was fried that allowed me to improve mpt everyone says do not sleep on mpt but imma say it again do not sleep on mpt can be aced with practice i really focused on noting for j and decided this time around it wasted too much time since its hours i set one timer for hours and then the other for i liked the fill in as you go method so i didnt need to be reminded of the min mark just keep an eye on the clock and mentally hope that you are done the cases by min mark step read to figure out type of file and make headers accordingly skim to figure out questions of law and header names and fill in step flip to back and see how many cases we are working with start with last case extract whatever legal rules and definitions and plug into headers you want to cite the statute when you can but its overwhelming reading it sometimes trying to figure out whats useful thats why i liked going with cases first cause if they used it there probably useful and should be cited step whoever recommended rpacc god bless you rule practice example of it being used application counterargument conclusion write it out abide by it made organization so much easier made engaging with the cases so much easier step go into facts and hammer away when practicing step read over the model answer and highlight whatever from the casesstatutesfacts that you used in colour a next search up that mpt online and find it for at least two other jurisdictions and do the same with different colours for me it was really helpful seeing what was actually useful factscase law from the different jurisdictions once i started noticing the types of patterns for overlaps it made me spotting them much easier practice practice practice i did at least of every type of mpt i wanted no surprises sometimes id do fully timed hour sessions sometimes id do a quick and dirty min outline and call it a day just being exposed to the different ways they lay things out and their expectations was so necessary mbe i thought this was a lost cause but i guess not i think the key here was recognizing when my brain was too tired and stop wasting questions i wanted to only do questions when i knew i was going to succeed like mentioned earlier memorizing keywords and buzzwords was essential sometimes those bastards try to trick you with random answers that are tempting if you dont know what they mean i think the real key here was learning the bll and just tons of practice i did probably over questions between quimbee ncbe emmannuel and whatever else random questions i found online exam day stopped any practice on the friday before the exam really focused on memorizing my outlines and rules reviewed my rule sheet the night before along with flashcards of keywords tried to keep it light but meaningful morning of day i have to review something before an exam so i reviewed the jd advising sheet on mpt formats and then reviewed my mee rule sheet eased my nerves a bit lunch day looked over my rules really quick but decided mental rest was more necessary night relax recharge review mbe cheat sheet rules of questions id constantly get wrong morning of day review rest of mbe cheat sheet that bitch was like pages lunch day do not look at materials do not look at reddit you will spook yourself eat relax hold on for dear life personal life dont focus so much as having the exact routine everyday some days you have more energy some days you have less you have to be gentle with yourself and accept that some days will be better than others j i was really strict with myself waking up at am to go for walks before an hour gym session eating all healthy studying for hours a day this not only was not enjoyable it was miserable f i really focused on sleep gave up on the gym i was having such bad crashes around pm because my body was exhausted and stocked up on healthy choice microwavable meals for lunch amazing would not have survived without them for calorie meal with grams of protein quick simple no dishes exactly what i needed j i was taking preworkout in the morning coffee around am and then caffine pill around pm f i went with a cup of coffee around if i was feeling like i needed it surprisingly enough getting enough sleep really helped who would have known id take time off when i needed it some nights i was fine going until pm but some nights i could tell my husband was lonely and id take time off do not feel guilty you need to refuel when i did go to the gym i made sure it was me time j i was doing flashcardsreading outlineslistening to bar podcasts no you do not need to devote your entire life to this exam you can take an hour a day for yourself when i did make it to the gym this time i made sure i put on some awful reality tv and or some music and enjoyed my workout we need we do not need we need confidence we need motivation we need stamina ok if you made is this far thanks for

1bzsdgj,Macros within 1200 calorie diet,i see a lot of people asking what their micronutrient should be while eating calories a day and i figured i make a post about it so take your calorie intake whatever that number is imma use mine it’s protein protein is essential to many processes in the body it provides structure to the tissue that includes cell membranes organs muscle hair skin nails bones tendons ligaments and blood plasma protein also takes longer to digest which causes a higher increase into the thermal effect of food which basically your body uses more energy to digest this macronutrient anyway – gkg of ideal body weight to preserve lean body mass or to glb converted is the rda and is ideal higher end for strength training and weight loss rda is recommended daily allowance based off weight so ideal body weight or lbm lean body mass which is body weight without fat pick what you want for your calculation i personally do lean body mass because to me i rather just make sure i have enough protein for the muscle i do have and not adding more because of the fat i have on my body so i’ll use that as the math example going forward so lb is my lean body mass so i’m going to take x rounded g of protein to convert that into calories take g x kal calories are in g of protein so total calories in protein is rounded so i have calories left carbs are the body’s primary fuel they provide energy for your muscles and the central nervous system during movement and exercise in regards to how much you need it depends on you you can do low carbs or high carbs i love carbs so i’ll probably do in carbs and fats for simplicity sake do what you need for you and change the numbers on these two so divide that by cals because there is cals in g of carbs so g of carbs fats fat is required for growth development and cell function because i am a women i tend to lean more towards more fat in my diet for hormone balance so take our remaining calories and divide by because cals t in g of fat so about g of fat macronutrients g proteins g of carbs and g of fat if you want more protein you can take from carbs easier because the are both cals of energy per gram so i could do g of protein g of carbs and g of fat and my calories would still be the same if you want to take from fat you will need do a bit more math so there are a lot of methods that you can do find what works for you and stick with it i hope this helps note i currently do calories in calories out and just make sure i am hitting my calorie goal and i’ll focus on macros later,see lot people asking micronutrient eating calories day figured make post take calorie intake whatever number imma use mine protein protein essential many processes body provides structure tissue includes cell membranes organs muscle hair skin nails bones tendons ligaments blood plasma protein also takes longer digest causes higher increase thermal effect food basically body uses energy digest macronutrient anyway gkg ideal body weight preserve lean body mass glb converted rda ideal higher end strength training weight loss rda recommended daily allowance based weight ideal body weight lbm lean body mass body weight without fat pick want calculation personally lean body mass rather make sure enough protein muscle adding fat body use math example going forward lb lean body mass going take rounded protein convert calories take kal calories protein total calories protein rounded calories left carbs body primary fuel provide energy muscles central nervous system movement exercise regards much need depends low carbs high carbs love carbs probably carbs fats simplicity sake need change numbers two divide cals cals carbs carbs fats fat required growth development cell function women tend lean towards fat diet hormone balance take remaining calories divide cals fat fat macronutrients proteins carbs fat want protein take carbs easier cals energy per gram could protein carbs fat calories would still want take fat need bit math lot methods find works stick hope helps note currently calories calories make sure hitting calorie goal focus macros later

black that hurts your eyes steam rolling off lexy those i dont know it starts after christmas a bunch of us in the square diner having coffee and cheesecake you wouldnt think the square would be a zoomer hangout its a redneck joint that opens extraearly in fall so hunters can eat breakfast and fill their coffee mugs before hitting the deer woods but we always go there instead of driving ten minutes across grace mountain to fastfood row in argenta the coffees cheap the cheesecakes not but tastes good aldo never hustles us out not until it gets to be closing time and our talks take twists nobodyd think of at mcdonalds like this night three or four days after christmas everything in drunken tree closed but the diner we got onto the subject of generations arguing was kevin gen y or a zoomer jacy said youre born in that makes you y lexy said all this generation shit iswell it doesnt mean shit unless theres some difference between generations like theres an assload of boomers because everyone had kids after world war ii and none of them understand computers my grandmother writes software asshole kevin said but whats different between x and y and z were all poor because of boomers were all internetaddicted i heard if you cant remember the twentieth century youre z kevin said i sure dont first thing i remember outside my own family is my mom watching tv and crying all day paul said i was born in i remember yk my gramma came to our house cause she thought her computer was gonna blow up meemaw made dad shut his computer off you werent even three and you remember that jacy scoffed she turned to me what about you nita i was born in so for sure im z i was born exactly between the centuries say what you know how some people say isnt really part of the new millenium that it really started in well it did lexy said theres no year zero unless you want the first century to have years then centuries gotta end in hundreds like yeah thats the math i agreed but see theres the scientific explanation and the the popular one so people say the twentieth century ended with but scientists say the twentyfirst starts with so isnt really either oneor else its both i shrugged my granddad says was like a reset year a grace year between the centuries and i was born right at the center of it how so jacy asked kevin was quicker what so you were born right at noon on the middle day of the year midnight i said leap year remember days near as i can tell i was born exactly between july first and second halfway between the centuries papa eddie says right at twelve nope i grinnedcaught him again at real midnight halfway between sunset and sunrise with daylight saving time it comes out about onethirteen in the morning the sun doesnt follow our clocks you know yeah well kevin shot back the sun didnt make our calendars either all the numbers are just made up the years and the clocks both look at chinese new year lexy pointed out all over the calendar even in europe the new year used to be in the middle of march jacy said she always had these weird historical facts at mcdonalds or subway we would have stopped there but in the square diner the conversation had another twist waiting its funny what your granddad says about being between the milleniums lexy said millenia paul corrected who cares anyway my pappaw used to say hed be rich if he could find someone born between years something he heard in vietnam what calendar do they use in vietnam paul asked like i know anyway he spent time in a village over there talking to the old folks they had this story about how you can like reach between days and pull out treasure yeah jacy scoffed how rich were they they didnt have the right person dumbass like i said you gotta have someone born between years like right exactly at midnight on new years eve only not exactly at twelve paul said but halfway between sunset and sunrise yeah whatever so before he can get the whole tale he goes back to his unit and maybe a week later viet cong burn the whole village jacy hissed lexy shrugged he thinks thats the end then while hes being shipped home he meets some irish guy in guam or someplace turns out theres an irish myth about the same thing jacy said and the irish guy drowns in the pacific before he gets the story lexy glared at her no the irish guy told him the whole thing and he told me find the magic person you can get rich you think nitas magic why not if between years is good between centuries ought to be a hundred times better as the magic person in question i was feeling a strange mix of fear greed and suspicion could i really get rich just from when i was born whats the catch i asked huh wheres the monkeypaw part are there monsters by the treasure is it what radioactive do you have to cut me open to get it what paul said well plutoniums worth like k a gram but its radioactive and trying to sell it would probly get you arrested kevin added cut you open jacy cried thats horrible hey i answered ireland was a goddam bloody place even before the protestants and catholics came in no catch lexy said interrupting its just really tricky to do he looked slantwise at me you were really born right at halfway of thats whats on my birth certificate i wasnt watching the clock myself far as i recall thats where that conversation ended aldo interrupted to ask if anyone wanted a last refill before he closed when hed finished topping everyone up we went off on a different subject new years eve it came up again this time it was just kevin and lexy and me at my house because we all celebrate sober and everyone else my parents tooyes im and living with them was at parties with booze kevin brought it up not lexy you never said he began how do you reach between days do you have to do it on new years eve or something like when your magic person is born no you can do it any night between any two days but its gotta be warm because you gotta do it outside it sure wasnt warm that night and it actually snowed four times over the two weeks after new years it got into the s the second thursday of january but it snowed again the very next day my dad made his usual if you dont like arkansas weather wait an hour joke my mom said shakespeare probably said that about london and lexy messaged me missed our chance this time want to try next time its warm you me and kevin i didnt pretend i didnt know what he meant id sort of hoped hed forget about it but id thought about it nearly every day sure i sent back but if i see monsters or knives imma nope tf out of there the last full week of january it warmed into the s what usually happens in winter warm spells happened we got a bunch of rain then heavy fog my folks house went from skincracking dry to sticky damp and i caught cold but the rain stopped after two days and lexy messaged me how about thursday night we met tuesday at the diner to make plans me sniffling into napkins all through pie and coffee im not giving all the details even if i wanted to i cantlexy never told me all of them but it wasnt some weird bloody mary ritual with chanting and stuff it was more something lexy and kevin built none of us could wear metal not even a tiny piece no jeans with zippers or rivets no shoes with eyelets no snaps drawstring sweats knit beanies sports bra for me turns out the strap rivets on my crocs were plastic so those were okay phones keys that stuff had to stay at least ten or twelve feet away what about in your body lexy asked me you ever had a broken arm or anything like with a pin in it so i had to google whether my iud had any metal i have the hormone kind so he thought it would be okay he was bright red when he said it kevin wasnt so shy ugh microplastics all up in you what about fillings teeth i asked that stopped him because all three of us had metal fillings i guess well just have to try it metal isnt dangerous it just might keep things from working and we had to rehearse because the one thing that absolutely had to go right was something i could only try once right on the dot of midnight kevin and lexy made a square of cotton thread it had to be hung off the ground it had to be a certain size the distance between the tips of my elbows if i touched fingertips in front of meabout three feet square they made other stuff but for me the thread square was the important part i had to jump through it without breaking any threads like leaping out a window it sounded easy at first the square was wider than most doors and im not fat lexyd used bright orange thread for visibility but keeping my head down while i tucked my feet up was tricky i wanted to dive through but lexy said i had to cannonballmy head and feet had to go through at the same time i dont know why i broke four of those thread windows before i got the hang of it my parents have a big back yard with lots of trees perfect to lexy he found a spot out of sight of the house where he could string up a square between trees threads from all four corners he took nearly an hour wednesday afternoon adjusting the anchoring threads because the window had to be as square as he could make it then he had to do it again on thursday because heavy dew wednesday night pulled it out of shape but that evening we were ready lexy and kevin were anyway i was getting scared again i still craved a treasure even if somehow we couldnt sell it even if we had to give it to a museum who doesnt want to discover hidden treasure maybe wed be famous but lexy said we were opening a hole between days whatever that meant and i was going to be the first one through i was afraid of what lay between i was afraid of monsters i was afraid of not having my phoneno metal allowed and i was blowing my nose every five minutes and wanted to go to bed not stand under trees in the dark and damp even if it was fifty degrees instead of fifteen like last week lexyd used a website to calculate sunset and sunrise with the gps coordinates for my folks back yard then figured true midnight at minutes and some seconds after clock midnight at i was crouched and waiting to jump dressed in sports bra panties sweats and knee socks no crocs wed cleared the ground so i could land without bruising my foot on a rock dim light around me from neighbors houses from the guys phones where they stood ten feet back watching the time lexy started counting down something else wed rehearsed and three and two and one and go i jumpedand at that exact moment i sneezed hard i must have kicked out or something just as i went through the thread window i snagged a thread snapped the window i didnt hear it didnt even feel it but i fell to my knees and knew id blown it i heard lexy swearing did you see that kevin said that flash i hadnt seen anything even against this dim light but lexy had seen it too theyd stood behind me while i jumped maybe the flash had faced toward them away from me i apologized over and over swearing i didnt know i was going to sneeze lexy didnt answer sulky but holding his temper but when kevin said we could try again friday or saturday he said saturday night im at a game tomorrow ill get it right saturday i said i swear i will and i did this time lexy strung two windows a few feet apart he said if i missed one i could try again maybe the time didnt have to be that exact its not like irish peasants could tell time to the second kevin pointed out yeah but they could use trial and error and how many irish peasants found treasure anyway while we were rehearsing lexy had wondered whether going between days was what started the story of leprechauns and rainbows and pots of gold i was still afraid but i was more scared of messing up again before i got in place i made kevin shine his phone flashlight in my eyes so id sneeze if i needed to then lexy started counting down and on go i jumped i knew when i landed id done it perfectly and just like that my heart was pounding and i felt dizzy i thought id been scared before now i learned better what id felt before was like worrying about an english test thisthis was getting home and seeing ambulances at the curb id opened a hole between days id heard lexy say holy shit as i landed so the loud gasp id heard was kevin now i heard kevin breathing fast behind me lexy hadnt made another sound i was too terrified to turn around and see yousee that lexy said finally yeah kevin choked now i was more afraid of not seeing i turned around the thread window hung between me and the guys still rippling a little from the wind of my jump it looked just the same both of them stared like a flamethrower was pointing through it i looked at them i looked at it i walked around to their side and i had to cover my mouth with both hands to keep from screaming from this side the side id jumped into the window was glowing except it was dark black a brilliant glowing black i know that makes no sense but thats what filled the space between the threads side to side and bottom to top a sheet of dazzling bright black like someone had caught a lightning bolt in a sheet of obsidian it was darker than the shadowy bushes behind it but i still almost had to squint to look at it it couldnt be real kevin turned his phone flashlight on again turned it that way the orange thread shone in the darkness but i couldnt see where the light fell on the square in between the thread was rippling from this side too but i couldnt see ripples in the black i dont understand why but scared as i was i was the first one to reach toward the window i stopped my hand a couple of inches from it the back of my hand glowed from kevins light my palm facing the window stayed dark my hand didnt cast a shadow the longer i stared the blacker it looked the brighter it looked so i touched it it felt firm i pressed it gave a little like an unopened bottle of coke not particularly warm or cold not slippery i pressed harder leaning to look sideways across the window i could feel it give feel my fingers denting it but i couldnt see a dent it was all uniform bright black leaning far enough to the side my fingertips disappeared into the dent now lexy came up i stepped back he pressed it like i had what the fuck he slammed his fist against it gave a grunt of pain i expected the window to boom like a drum but there was just a little slapping noise he shoved with both hands its supposed to be a door its a window i said not really thinking whatever what goods a window you cant go through he punched it again a third time tucked his fist into his armpit and hissed shit kevin picked up a pebble from the little pile wed cleared from my landing spot tossed it at the window i thought it would bouncebut it disappeared lexy and i gaped kevin poked the black with a stick the stick bent the tip snapped off he tossed the stick underhand endwise it slid through the glowing sheet without slowing down nothing fell behind the window you gotta jump he said you cant be touching the ground lexy stared at that threefoot square two feet off the ground and for all i was scared blind i had to laugh hed made me practice over and over but hed never tried jumping through it himself but there a few feet away was the spare window hed made he looked at it shit no time like now he backed up tugged his sweatshirt down straight and snug took a couple of steps and launched himself headfirst through the window i was amazed to see him do a nearly perfect dive roll parkour style on the other side land on hands roll over back come up on feet he hadnt even brushed any of the threads what about cannonballs i said you wouldnt let me dive through and your phone that was all to open it i just have to go through he pushed kevin aside backed up and ran at the brilliant black square he leaned forward thrust out his arms and jumped just before his hands reached it i thought hed bounce back he didnt he disappeared hands arms head body legs feet gone kevin looked at the black window at me at the window now what do we do i thought lexy would jump back through i thought hed toss jewels or gold statues or something back through i thought hed come back but he didnt kevin tried phoning lexy he got rolled to voice mail immediately i texted him nothing came back we couldnt shout not with my parents asleep in the house and neighbors not far away but we talked to the window from right beside it kevin pressed his ear to it he couldnt hear anything he knocked shave and a haircut on it but we didnt even hear his knuckle hitting much less any answer we sat in my folks back yard and waited it had been in the s friday afternoon but now it got cold fast we talked a little bit but it all came back to whens he gonna come back i kept waiting for kevin to say i should go after him maybe kevin was waiting for me to say it neither one of us did it might have been heroic for kevin to jump after himbut it might have been really stupid too what if there wasnt any ground on the other side what if there was a dragon the longer i sat and the colder i got the stupider i felt and i was angry with lexy and kevin too both these guys were older than mewhy hadnt one of them said this is a bad idea it was like those internet memes why women live longer than men it was close to getting cold as hell and i was wondering if i could stand waiting here all night when the window went out neither one of us saw it happen i glanced up and that dazzling black was gone just pale thread dark bushes shadows beneath trees it had hung there about an hour and ten minutes after i jumped through about an hour after lexy jumped through now i realized neither one of us had tried taking a picture of it what would my phone have seen pointed at that glowing black square im going in the house i said hes dead or hes lost or something kevin didnt say anything he followed me back to the house walked around to the driveway drove away it was lucky theyd come in his car or id have to explain why lexys car was in our driveway saturday morning but lexy always got people to drive him places i spent nearly all day saturdaya week ago the last saturday of januaryin bed telling mom my cold was worse again i guess i cried a little i hadnt really liked lexy not the way i liked jacy or kevin lexy was too selfish too spiteful but he could be funny and my other friends liked him around i hadnt wanted something to happen to him im not going to describe this week all the messages and posts asking wheres lexy has anyone seen lexy did lexy tell anybody where he was going all that i couldnt call in sick forever so i went to work monday like normal though i still had a cough and runny nose kevin told people he and lexy had hung out at my house friday night then hed taken lexy home and and hadnt seen him since i told people we played exploding kittens sat in the yard for a while then the guys left so nobody knew where lexy was but nobody called the police either a yearold single guy who doesnt get along with his parents doesnt have a girlfriend doesnt show up for workwhos going to stir up shit about him but february st was even warmer up in the s and kevin came over to my house are those threads still there iont know lets look back in the trees the first window the one id opened was sagging a bird or something had broken one of the threads but the spare window still looked square i cant stand wondering kevin said you think you can jump through again dont want to but ive got an idea a way how i wont get stuck over there and ill leave my phone in case thats what messed lexy up i can do it right this timebut not unless you open a window again find somebody else born between years theres gotta be somebody else yeah maybe six or eight people in the whole state even if it doesnt have to be the exact second even if it just has to be the right minute you know how many minutes there are in a year five hundred twentyfive thousand six hundred i said automatically mom loves to watch rent and cry over angel which means about one person in half a million is born in that minute between december and january there arent half a million in the nearest ten counties therere barely three million in the whole state tag nita youre it i argued a while longer but there really wasnt anybody else at last i gave in but if you get lost too im not going after you it didnt happen that night though a family emergency came updetails dont matter to this storyand i had to go to harrison with my parents kevin must have texted me twenty times frantic something would happen to the threads that night or friday i had to mute him to get through the day i was back friday afternoon friday midnight we were under the trees it had hit the s again and the humidity had shot up now the cooling air was heavy and damp thick in my lungs and sinuses he couldnt find the website that let lexy calculate midnight to the second but he had the minute at least it had barely changed to he did all the things and i did my jump and there was the bright black again hed brought a little folding step stool the kind my mom uses to reach high cabinets hed practiced jumping off it backward feet first his plan was to jump backward through the window as soon as his feet went through id grab his hands standing on the ground my hands wouldnt go through as long as he could keep his grip he could pull himself back by me hed look around come back tell me what he saw maybe lexy was alive over there but couldnt find the window and kevin could lead him back through or maybe kevin could find treasure pass it back to me i thought maybe hed get halfway through fall on the edge of the window cut himself in half but i didnt say that what would my parents do if i ran and told them half of kevin was lying in their yard he set the step stool by the broken thread window to let me practice grabbing his hands as he jumped they felt clammy in the damp air he said even if i only caught one it would work and it would be on him not me to make sure he didnt lose his grip all i had to do was catch his hand and keep my feet on the ground so we did it he put his phone with mine moved the stool climbed up with his back to the window then kicked himself off i saw his feet disappear grabbed at his hands caught just one of them his hand closed hard around my right wrist his body disappeared his head his loose arm and hand i expected my hand to slam into the black window i hoped it wouldnt hurt but id stood too far back as he disappeared his grip on my wrist yanked me off my feet for a fraction of a second i was off the groundand he pulled my hand through the window i landed falling trying to get breath to scream because now the windows edge would cut me in half but i threw out my left hand and with my feet back on the ground it thumped into the window and stopped me the black as solid as before my right hand felt a weird sort of burning itching sensation like id buried it in hot beach sand i braced my left hand against the black and shoved as hard as i could and my right hand pulled back out kevins hand still gripping it a few seconds later his head came through and he started wheezing and coughing whats wrong i cried no cough noair cough he had blood on his lips coughed blood onto my hand pull i cough got him i pulled and he pulled and lexys body came through the window steam rolled off it in clouds i jerked back from it afraid of being burned i knew he was dead this morningsaturdaythe skin of my right hand and half my forearm was deep red like a really fresh bruise thats just what it was i figured out kevin managed to explain a bit before he passed out i worked out the rest myself he said there was ground a little lighteverything looked like the glowing blackbut there was no heat at all over there without air pressure blood pressure had ruptured vessels in my skin it was like a big suck mark a hickey over my entire hand it doesnt really hurt its a little tender when i type but kevin was entirely in vacuum for a while he got that red skin over his whole body his eyeballs didnt explode none of that movie junkbut theyre really bloodshot worse hes got ruptures all through his lungs hes in intensive care on pure oxygen they say even if he doesnt get pneumonia from the blood and fluid in his lungs he could still die from the damage or be left crippled it took me longer to figure out why he didnt freeze see space isnt really freezing cold not like guardians of the galaxy when peoples faces crystallize if they dont have a space suit when theres no air at all instead of super cold youre kind of insulated in those few seconds kevins upper body suffered from vacuum but not cold but the ground sucked heat from his sock feettheyd frozen almost instantly frostbite had killed flesh on the bottoms of his feet all the way to the bone his wool socks had crumbled holding lexys jacketthe nylon didnt get brittlehis hand had frozen too if he survived hed lose the ends of his fingers when i pulled kevin back he was able to move able to hold lexys jacket collar kevin was able to step through stand up unsteadily pull lexy after him he lifted lexy with one hand holding him clear of the window threads lexys stiff body was bent partly doubled up like hed fallen on his side kevin pulled him out of the black put his feet on the ground then kevins frozen feet and a new coughing fit doubled him over he lost his grip on lexy the body fell toward me steaming i thought id be knocked flat scalded but it seemed almost weightless as it struck my shoulder and spun away falling on its face then onto its side my shoulder felt burned i heard cracking sounds as it hit the ground i saw that lexys nose had shattered the fingers of his left hand had snapped off he rolled sideways into a tree trunk and his entire right arm broke off i did scream now but it was breathless and weak kevin had been there for a few seconds the ground had frozen his feet but lexy had been over there for a week seven solid days of lying on ground without a bit of heat his flesh had frozen then vacuum had pulled water from it like freezerburned steak you find forgotten behind the microwave lasagna his corpse only weighed thirty or forty pounds most of the water gone when kevin pulled him through he steamed in the humid airfog condensing around his frozen corpse id felt burning cold not heat on my shoulder he hadnt busted into a billion tiny chunks when he fell over maybe because he was so dried out but he was brittle enough his nose and hand had shattered and his arm had snapped off he turned white with frost as i watched each broken finger gleamed white on dead leaves kevin couldnt walk and i couldnt carry him i ran back to the house to wake up my dad calling on the way before dad got there kevin came to and dragged himself away from the window and lexys frosted body my parents dont know about them yet neither do the police im going to have to explain how in one week lexy got freezedried and broken into pieces so ive spent all day typing this maybe theyll believe me probably they wont but how else will they explain whats caught in whats left of lexys left hand he had three two fell on the ground when his fingers broke apart ive got them here by my keyboard the third is still caught under his shriveledup thumb but i believe its exactly the same as these theyre coins big around as an oreo cookie nearly as thick one side has three tall narrow trees poplars i think growing on a hilltop the other side has a stone tower with battlements two spears crossed above it ive googled the designs and cant find anything like them the designs are still sharp the coins look nearly new for lexy to grab three right by the black window in what the internet says must have been less than a minute before he went unconscious im guessing there were probably a metric assload of them lying around over there from the weight from the color from how they ring from how theres no tarnish or corrosion id say theyre gold pure gold drunken tree stories,things youll find easy believe warm february weather catching cold sure orange threads black hurts eyes steam rolling lexy dont know starts christmas bunch us square diner coffee cheesecake wouldnt think square would zoomer hangout redneck joint opens extraearly fall hunters eat breakfast fill coffee mugs hitting deer woods always go instead driving ten minutes across grace mountain fastfood row argenta coffees cheap cheesecakes tastes good aldo never hustles us gets closing time talks take twists nobodyd think mcdonalds like night three four days christmas everything drunken tree closed diner got onto subject generations arguing kevin gen zoomer jacy said youre born makes lexy said generation shit iswell doesnt mean shit unless theres difference generations like theres assload boomers everyone kids world war ii none understand computers grandmother writes software asshole kevin said whats different poor boomers internetaddicted heard cant remember twentieth century youre kevin said sure dont first thing remember outside family mom watching tv crying day paul said born remember yk gramma came house cause thought computer gon na blow meemaw made dad shut computer werent even three remember jacy scoffed turned nita born sure im born exactly centuries say know people say isnt really part new millenium really started well lexy said theres year zero unless want first century years centuries got ta end hundreds like yeah thats math agreed see theres scientific explanation popular one people say twentieth century ended scientists say twentyfirst starts isnt really either oneor else shrugged granddad says like reset year grace year centuries born right center jacy asked kevin quicker born right noon middle day year midnight said leap year remember days near tell born exactly july first second halfway centuries

16t16di,One reason teaching is hard. And why I'm drinking whiskey tonight.,you care you have to care or you get burnt out caring keeps me connecting to these kids meet x x is a hard kid with a pretty serious discipline history but i looked past all that within days he is calling me sir doing his work within a week he stopped cussing as much and started apologizing when he did i went out of my way to build a relationship with that little shit and i was getting to him the kid is smart as hell and he is a genuinely nice kid most of the time because of his big personality he was a class leader if his hardcore ass was into the lesson the rest were paying attention it is so aggravating to see them fuck up their lives today he brought a fairly significant amount of marijuana to school and did really nothing to hide the smell i had him first period but didnt smell anything on or around him i smelled cigarette smoke something im sensitive to since i quit smoking quite a while back but in a more general way around some other students i know their parents smoke fine considering it was grams im surprised i didnt notice it they started chasing it down this morning when someone was spreading rumors then people started reporting a smell and by sixth period he had passed it on to some girls to hold for him at the end of the day they figured out x had done it and snagged up both girls involved i found out later the dean tried to stop x but he ignored him pretty blatantly and booked it off campus since he already has a conviction for something else and is on a behavior contract he just got expelled meet y y is another kid i worked hard with she is a girl who largely presents as a male but i think that is more of a function of the way she looks she isnt traditionally pretty at all i initially thought she was male until i checked the roster the school gave us i think because of that she has dealt with some bullying in her life so she has done some fighting which is why i say that she is very quiet and has been extremely well behaved for me same as x smart as hell with a smaller discipline history but still some bad choices as im walking out today i see the dean hauling y and the other girl up to the front office so i walked into discipline to ask what happened i reamed out y a bit then went and told the boss this is the kind of thing that pisses me off he was also very upset we all had hopes x was turning it around and for him to drag down two othersfuck the entire front office smelled like the weed because he had it bagged up in multiple bags they might get him with distribution which is a second felony for him and no matter what both girls that held the weed are done alternative school for all three of them ill be shocked if y doesnt beat the piss out of x and he will deserve it but like i told her she learned a valuable lesson you never hold anything for anyone fuck imma drink a bit early release tomorrow so fuck it if im hungover a bit update all three expelled and since x has a record and all that he is getting it worse sigh back to it on monday i guess,care care get burnt caring keeps connecting kids meet hard kid pretty serious discipline history looked past within days calling sir work within week stopped cussing much started apologizing went way build relationship little shit getting kid smart hell genuinely nice kid time big personality class leader hardcore ass lesson rest paying attention aggravating see fuck lives today brought fairly significant amount marijuana school really nothing hide smell first period didnt smell anything around smelled cigarette smoke something im sensitive since quit smoking quite back general way around students know parents smoke fine considering grams im surprised didnt notice started chasing morning someone spreading rumors people started reporting smell sixth period passed girls hold end day figured done snagged girls involved found later dean tried stop ignored pretty blatantly booked campus since already conviction something else behavior contract got expelled meet another kid worked hard girl largely presents male think function way looks isnt traditionally pretty initially thought male checked roster school gave us think dealt bullying life done fighting say quiet extremely well behaved smart hell smaller discipline history still bad choices im walking today see dean hauling girl front office walked discipline ask happened reamed bit went told boss kind thing pisses also upset hopes turning around drag two othersfuck entire front office smelled like weed bagged multiple bags might get distribution second felony matter girls held weed done alternative school three ill shocked doesnt beat piss deserve like told learned valuable lesson never hold anything anyone fuck imma drink bit early release tomorrow fuck im hungover bit update three expelled since record getting worse sigh back monday guess
16kgt0b,Which one of you did this?,,
1645jn9,No fucking way they got fake slugga ig scams going on 😭😭😭,,
15ulwb7,routine addiction,okay this isnt something specific to x but i do think its in the gekyume level of thought so if i was to stick my hand in fire and not react and someone saw that it would be uncomfortable to them they are physically pained by something being different out of the norm or as heath ledger joker said nobody cares as long as everything goes according to plan but if the plan was this and this happens everyone loses their mind and they dont care about eachother when the chips are down they will tear eachother apart if you want proof you could get a bag fill it with dollar bills and lets say you put k in the bag in s fucking dollar bills and you throw those out your car window people would rush to it as if its some miracle they would fight over it and maybe even hurt eachother over some stupid piece of paper but back to my previous point they are addicted to routine and do the same thing everyday they think in terms of normal or weird weird is anything they arent used to and anything they are uneducated about normal is what they do and know which is just rediculous like they never experience new things because its comfortable to not do that i like this and thats all i need then they talk shit on random things that they have literally never once experienced they stay to the same religion the same political view the same gaming system hell the same car sometimes like one brand of car they go to extremes of like this works so i dont need anything else but thats just sad why would you not want to experience more in life dont be like them try new things eat octopus drink cactus juice 😏 if yk yk have some mushrooms from time to time 😂 okay that was a joke im nit a drug advocate but i have tried shrooms and in low dosages grams youre big chillin but fr mix things that dont seem pike they would go good together or if they do but never have how do you think we get new things you could make the next doritooreotakimonster energy you know like you could make something that generates millions if youd just try new things do it with more than just food if you have a situation where something youre doing anything even normal shit like a shower if you see areas to improve do your own lil diy to improve it and if its amazing improvement then check if it already exists and if not check if theres a patent for it and if not try to get a patent and then try selling it youd be surprised at what your mind can come up with if youre constantly problem solving like imagine theres something you can do to improve every situation then while imagining this come up with ways to do so im not some pussy i dont care if someone steals my ideas so imma share one right now criticize it please if you can think of ways to criticize it because that would help me i understand that so anyways i was vaping a lot and i realized i dont like vaping its just fun to do tricks with it and i like the specifically ice variety how it gives me a cold feeling on my lungs so i quit because it was making me sick but i still crave it even a year later right now i still do but i came up with a way for people to fight addiction and actually benefit in a healthy way so were all aware of essential oil and air purifiers im sure idk how no one thought of this but imagine basically a portable air purifier in the form of a vape i wont give all the details on my proprietary idea because i really wanna patent it lol its really good like the mechanism idea i have but basically youd be inhaling steam which if that was bad for you you couldnt be in a sauna which is a steam hotbox lol so i know its safe and i just gotta make it but i can use essential oil and or tea type mixtures for the flavor 🤞 sending love and positivity good day everyone ✌️☯️,okay isnt something specific think gekyume level thought stick hand fire react someone saw would uncomfortable physically pained something different norm heath ledger joker said nobody cares long everything goes according plan plan happens everyone loses mind dont care eachother chips tear eachother apart want proof could get bag fill dollar bills lets say put bag fucking dollar bills throw car window people would rush miracle would fight maybe even hurt eachother stupid piece paper back previous point addicted routine thing everyday think terms normal weird weird anything arent used anything uneducated normal know rediculous like never experience new things comfortable like thats need talk shit random things literally never experienced stay religion political view gaming system hell car sometimes like one brand car go extremes like works dont need anything else thats sad would want experience life dont like try new things eat octopus drink cactus juice yk yk mushrooms time time okay joke im nit drug advocate tried shrooms low dosages grams youre big chillin fr mix things dont seem pike would go good together never think get new things could make next doritooreotakimonster energy know like could make something generates millions youd try new things food situation something youre anything even normal shit like shower see areas improve lil diy improve amazing improvement check already exists check theres patent try get patent try selling youd surprised mind come youre constantly problem solving like imagine theres something improve every situation imagining come ways im pussy dont care someone steals ideas imma share one right criticize please think ways criticize would help understand anyways vaping lot realized dont like vaping fun tricks like specifically ice variety gives cold feeling lungs quit making sick still crave even year later right still came way people fight addiction actually benefit healthy way aware essential oil air purifiers im sure idk one thought imagine basically portable air purifier form vape wont give details proprietary idea really wan na patent lol really good like mechanism idea basically youd inhaling steam bad couldnt sauna steam hotbox lol know safe got ta make use essential oil tea type mixtures flavor sending love positivity good day everyone

11rnwnh,"For Beginners by a Beginner- To avoid, where to start, other answers",i got bored so i wrote everything ive learned since i was ever interested in perfumery since the moment i asked myself i wonder if i could make my own perfume this is based off the order of questions ive asked or asked myself when i started pursuing this might keyword might prevent some of the repetitive questions asked on here and it might save some people some time what im about to write sure wouldve saved me some time if you are experienced please read the very bottom of this before stomping me please xd this is for people who are thinking about the simple notion of perfumery and for those who are a bit into it already the stage before studying and experimenting essential oils and fragrance oils if you just bought some roll on perfumes and are asking yourself maybe i could learn to make something like this read this essential oils unless youre looking for natural perfumes and aromatherapy dont buy an essential oil kit especially not from amazon pure essential oil does not mean its real essential oils besides essential oils are probably not what youre looking for if you got an oil based roll on from etsy or an indie perfume house they are probably synthetic mixes of aroma chemicals and maybe theres an eo or two in there or it could be made with fragrance oils keep reading ill get to that there are certainly reasons to make essential oil perfumes but not if you want anything complex besides mixing too many essential oils will become mud there are too many scent molecules that make an eo to hope that they will just work together and smell good with other eos there are ways to mix essential oils and there are natural perfumery courses if this is what you want seek trusted essential oil sellers like doterra and such if you simply looked up how to make your own perfume you will probably end up with articles about essential oil blends telling you to mix drops of bergamot with drops of lavender etc etc stop there please dont use drops to measure all perfumery is done with weight measurements and a scale these blends arent truly perfumery as you may think or will lead you to the objective you have in mind besides this method is probably unsafe for the skin especially if youre trying to use cinnamon fragrance oils also probably not your objective fragrance oils are synthetic blends meant mostly for soap candles etc but not really for perfumery mixing fragrance oils will likely turn up more muddy or just as muddy as mixing essential oils some people use fragrance oils to make perfumes but it does not really encourage your own creativity nor does it really allow for your creativity i dont encourage this but i will share the answers ive obtained about fragrance oils in terms of perfumery its easy and cheap to make but kinda soulless and definitely not as good as real perfume first of all buy fragrance oils from sites that give you an ifra safety doc on the shop page of that specific fragrance oils please make sure it has one to avoid risks on your skin then look for category of ifra safety that is the safe of fragrance oil you can put in a finished product with perfume intentions if it says and youre making a g ml bottle but use grams rollon put g of fragrance oil and g of fractionated coconut oil or other carrier truly starting ok i wanna do more authenticcomplex perfumes so where do i actually start i will try to give you my best advice that was given to me from others firstly ask yourself if you are willing to learn its not something you can pick up and create something amazing in a week its going to take time experimentation and some failures oh and there is some math not too hard trust me plus we have everyone on this subreddit to help out secondly are you willing to spend uhh moderately for this hobby surely people may not spend as much as i didam depending on how they start out and i encourage people who have experience to share how they started out and learned but ive spent about dollars already granted about was for a learning course the rest was between a materials kit solvents pipettes a scale bottles and scent strips seek kitsmaterials from perfumers apprenticecreatingperfumes if youre from na for uk the only one i know about is pellwall im sure replies here or in other posts of this reddit will give you more good sources personally i bought the scenthusiasm materials kit from perfumers apprentice you could start with a great range of materials just a few or start from a certain fragrance category whatever you do it might be best to get and learn the most common materials and also try to focus on one fragrance category even if you get an extensive kit so you dont spread your knowledge out too thin better to master one then some than try all at once as far as everyones told me about perfumery youre gonna need some bottles pipettes blottersscent test strips and a scale look for amber boston rounds i personally use ml boston rounds with polycone liner caps as for atomizers for spray perfumes and roll on bottlessmaller boston round bottles for oil based perfumes that depends on the size of your final products and preferences use plastic pipettes not glass you can get pipettes and blotters rather cheap in bulk bottles are a bit more expensive in bulk i found a pc ml pack for which isnt too bad as for a scale that also depends on your budget but get one thats decimal spaces not just i have a g capacity scale and it does its job if youre worried about accuracy youll have to pay more pocket scales like mine are around also get some small labels gotta know whats in your bottles i got all this stuff from amazon i use a software called evernote free for one device to note all my dilutions in a very organized fashion i also record everything there up to and including the weight of my bottles for each material thats in them idk if thats too intensive but imma continue doing it just in case i miss something anyway a note app is good for recording what you think about every materials scent ideas dilutions etc seek informationlearning from reliabledecent sources basenotescom and this subreddit has helped me tremendously but i dont know a lot of sources tbh and if the comments could help out with that that would be great as for youtubers bk scents and sam macer are good as well as sarah mccartney i could also use help extending this list learning by yourself probably isnt easy but there are some organized courses a lot of them are expensive scenthusiasms gbp is pretty tame compared to some others which are upward of euros i completely understand going the route of being self taught but i dont have any tips for that if someone does please feel free to share oil based perfumes vs alcohol based perfumes i am likely to still struggle with this eventually but i will tell you what i know short answer alcohol based perfumes is such an easier route you will have so much fewer questions and more people to answer them as per my experience let me tell you what i know about them though if im wrong you disagree or im missing details feel free to add oil based perfumes this stuff you dont spray this usually comes in the format of rollon bottles or amber bottles where you gotta find something to dip in it and apply to your skin if youre interested in this you will likely be working mostly with ipm ipm isopropyl myristate is a solventdiluent it is mostly used in oil based perfumes it holds the scent down and it makes the perfume more intimate you likely wont be leaving a trail as you walk by someone and mostly only you can smell it you could also mix ipm and other fixed oils such as fractionated coconut oil pros more intimate doesnt dry skin and arent as at all photosensitive like alcohol perfumes and ipm is cheaper to get cons more intimate not as volatile may last generally longer ipm might not dissolve some things as easily as dpg or alcohol i need someone to let me know if ipm and dpg can be mixed and if ipm and alcohol can be mixed another con its hard to find certain materials especially on perfumers apprentice that arent prediluted in alcohol im not sure if this can be used in oil based perfumes or not with ipm involved certainly not with fractionated coconut oil edit ipm and dpg are miscible tec can also be used for oil based perfumes all three of those are miscible with alcohol however only tec and ipm of these three can mix with fixed oils such as fractionated coconut oil turns out you can make a fragrance raw and dilute it to desired concentration with ipm dpg or tec and just leave it as is counting as an oil based perfume you do not need to cap it off with fractionated coconut oil this allows for what im about to say next it is not particularly practiced from what ive read and heard but your end result is still an oil based perfume if you must use a material prediluted in alcohol in your blend just make it a huge point to remember and specify for yourself and others that there is some alcohol content in it alcohol based perfumes the stuff you spray can be pretty much be used with all solventsdiluents besides those that are fixed oils most things dissolve in alcohol alcohol based perfumes are more volatile and you will likely smell it if a wearer passes by you i think you can pursue alcohol based perfumes with a bit more confidence as answers are much more easily accessible pros high volatility easier to usemake less problems in more senses than one cons alcohol is more expensive some countries you need a permitlicense detectable to others and thats bad if you dont want any attention math and dilutions first of all its not recommended to predilute anything really unless its super strong or if you need to use a lot less of a material in a formula however my scenthusiasm course and the perfumers apprentice kit for scenthusiasm requires me to predilute a lot of my stuff for the sake of learning therefore i will explain some math that i was about to ask in this subreddit but figured out once i thought about it when it wasnt am in the morning after a long day at work heres some examples of what you may cross i have an undiluted material that i want to be at easyyy first come up with how much of a solution you want my kit came with ml bottles of material i have ml boston rounds so i decided g is a good start i guess so of grams is g x a ratio of one part material parts alcohol parts total take out your scale calibrate it put your bottle with the lid off on it tare it and pump g of alcohol or other diluentsolvent into it with a plastic pipette record how close you got on a notes app or on paper tare it to again grab another plastic pipette and pump g of the material into it record that as well keep these notes voilà g of material at label the bottle i put a round label with the name of the material and the then i put another round label on the bottom with the total grams in it and the with the solvent used for example the top sticker would say pyralone alc and the bottom alc g then i put a rectangle label saying the same as the top one im taking no chances for a label to blur or peel off itself i record my empty bottle weight too for each bottle i use i record the weight of the cap the weight of the bottle and the weight of the bottle with the cap i do this to be thorough and this could allow me to know how much is exactly left later on after using some that may be intensive but im not taking chances p i have a prediluted material at alcohol already but i need it at this one was hard to wrap my head around at first but here ya go i also decided to do this at g because it seemed like i would still have plenty of the material left over for later so for this we need part material at already and parts alcohol think thats parts total ok so just part would be x g g so you need g of the material and g of the alcohol to make a total of g measure that all out and record it for each measurement you should now have from what was i have a prediluted material at and it needs to be easier to wrap your head around than the last

yw59eq,4 AM Ramblings on 10 years in the hobby and 3 years with the Susvara.,edit alright so the format looked a lot better in google docs but a nightmare here on reddit so ill link that here as well oh shit i wrote a novel google docs says pages alright so i’m writing this note here after having written everything below uhh proceed at your own risk i couldn’t sleep and i was typing this up at in the morning so please don’t take it too seriously but i hope to have at least gotten a chuckle outta you if you do attempt to read it but uhhhhh tldr you didn’t read good don’t its the big kahuna the big boy the ben this year would mark my th year in the hobby of personal audio or collecting headphones i say collecting headphones but it’s really just buying and selling a whole bunch of gear so why should you care you shouldn’t i’m just celebrating the whole numbers in my life or whatever it’s called milestones to be honest i don’t think my experience is as vast as some newcomers that came onto the scene say like a year ago i haven’t been able to try out all the latest and greatest headphones or try out all the amps and dacs i’ve mostly dabbled in entrylevel to midfi headphones and vintage headphones i mention this just in case you were wondering if there may be a takeaway from someone’s “ year experience” of being in the hobby i mean even i don’t know i’m just writing this as i’m going along so we’ll see i’ll try to talk about the “noteworthy” headphones in my journey for reference here’s a list of headphones that i’ve owned here most of which i no longer have i think there’s over headphones and earphonesiems that i’ve owned in the past years i made the list a few years into it so i might’ve forgotten some entries it is in chronological order though so i did start with the audio technica athms well technically i started off with a pair of beats by dre studio i remember seeing people wear them at school and thinking they were the coolest headphones ever mind you this was the st version with the cheap plastic and having to use aa batteries to power them i mean dr dre was the brainchild for them so they had to be good i remember going to target and best buy many times just to try them out at the kiosks i was like “yooooooo these headphones are sooo good the bass is so loud” so i cracked and finally bought a pair of fake ones i couldn’t even imagine spending more than dollars on a pair of headphones i think tyll from innerfidelity has said or written that monster and dr dre really pushed the norm of spending more for headphones to the masses and i agree i was close to doing so but i was broke so i chose the next best thing lol wellllll i was none the wiser and i remember using the fake beats while i watched toradora the anime the entirety in one sitting yes all episodes one of the sides cracked within a few weeks of use which prompted me to look into more “serious” headphones that led me to this video and the rest is history but only i know about this history of mine so i’ll expand on this i bought a pair of athms online from a local guitar center on black friday of i mean the world was ending anyway so i might as well splurge a little right well to be honest i don’t think i was able to hear a difference between the ms and the fake beats studio i mean i had maybe or headphones before and i thought all headphones sounded the same prior to the beats kiosks of course i wouldn’t be able to tell the difference but our lord and savior mkbhd said they were better than beats at a lower price so i kept them months later i made an account on headfiorg and that’s where i learned the true meaning of “sorry about your wallet” if only i stayed content and ignorant i could’ve used that cash money elsewhere headfi says i made my account on july th man it must’ve been an uneventful day that year if i spent the day browsing on a headphone forum lol to those outside of the us july th is independence day or basically an excuse to party shoot fireworks and reunite with certain family members you’d rather not meet again uncle tim but anyways as to why i made an account on headfi i think i heard about the site through a youtube video or maybe by googling “help my ms no longer blocks out the voices in my head need upgrade” probably the latter as that was when i learned about openback headphones oooooo instead of isolating the voices in my head with a closedback i can let some of the ambient noises in and that can help drown out the voices doubly with music actually lmao i found the first thread i made on headfi and that is exactly the reason why i just searched it up as i’m writing this here’s that thread aaaugghhhh you know that feeling when you read your really old facebook posts from your middle school or high school days yeah that’s the feeling i’m getting oh shoot i also had a klipsch s at the time wuuuuuut that was the really hyped iem at the time i think yoooo who else remembers that i hated those lmao they were so unreliable i had a replacement unit fail on me the day i got them iirc the plug had broken off lol i think i had to get them replaced a total of times by the time the warranty ran out on my last warranty claim for them i remember klipsch sending me their successor to the s the r if you thought hifiman was bad the klipsch s was really something else and looking at my post history i posted up another help me thread and was led to the etymotic hf i was also looking at the yamaha ephsl shure se rockit sounds r yooo who remembers theseeee brainwavz b and theesseeee and the aforementioned hf oh man i just had a blast to the past reading these iem models i was so close to getting the rockit sounds r i believe they use the same ba drivers as the brainwavz b but i couldn’t fathom using overtheear iems imagine that the brainwavz b were slightly out of my price range at the time and i’ve read posts of them failing with the whole klipsch s debacle in mind i went with the etymotic hf i don’t remember what i thought about the sound of them to be honest i just remember the noise isolation being extremely good i mean my eardrums were touched by something that wasnt just soundwaves for the first time sorry i just realized i was going to talk about my first openback headphones but while going through my old posts it seemed like i was looking for solid iems first here’s that thread by the way like i said no rhyme or reason nor structure to my writing here i’m just writing as i’m going i’m sorry ok but yeah i also made a help me thread for open back headphones here’s that sorta skimming through my old posts and i think i puked inside my mouth a little at the time i was considering the akg q soundmagic hp sennheiser hd beyerdynamic dt and the zmf classic v yooo who else remember these sorry i’m going through memory lane i think the zmf classic v was semiopen or closed but they were also recommended to me well long story short i went with the soundmagic hp and that was a nightmare and a half basically just a whole qc mess went through pairs i believe by the way the soundmagic hp that zeos reviewed that was mine may or may not be a fun fact i thought it was fun which is why i mentioned it also ayo soundmagic what happened to the hp neverforget they were supposed to have wooden earcups or something anyways yeah i should’ve gone for literally anything but the soundmagic lmao but ehh no ragrets i learned something that day i think something about buying only triedandtrue headphones or something i dunno so yeah then i bought an ortofon eq if you don’t know what that is yeeaaaahhh i didn’t learn my lesson i kept on buying obscure headphonesiems maybe that’s my takeaway from my years in the hobby “only buy headphones that many other people have also tried” or “don’t buy obscure headphones” but not long after i traded my aurisonics forte for a flare audio r good god i’m realizing now that i never learned who the hell has an aurisonics forte or the flare audio r for that matter both are terrible by the way the r significantly worse and by significantly worse i mean they are by far the worst headphones i have ever tried from the one hundreds and thirty headphones i’ve tried i cannot even think of another headphone that comes close to how bad these sound i’ve said this before but they rival airline earbuds no really tyll from innerfidelity has actually measured them you know i wouldn’t be this angry if you know they were like maybe usd or maybe even usd if you wanna push it but noooooo they retailed for usd i don’t speak french so excuse my french but what the fuck i’ve written an essay at this point so i’m not even going to get into the abomination that is the flare audio r and the depths of my rage let me ask you this have you ever listened to a headphone so repulsive that the darkness that you didn’t know you had within you came up to the surface and out through your orifices yeah i pooped my pants well i probably didn’t but for the sake of this bit i did it’s my story shut up i should also mention that they weren’t comfortable at all they had the clamping force of a hippo’s bite and the padding of a lazily packed amazon package like ups can you explain how my new phone boxed within a box arrived in smithereens no i did not buy a modular phone “david” if that’s even your real name speaking of david i went to my first headphone meet in there wasn’t anyone named david there i just didn’t know how to segway into this so that’s what i’m going with it was hosted by a local audio shop but organized by fellow headfiers i was extremely nervous going into this event because firstly social anxiety but secondly i was afraid that i might get called out for my lack of experience i mean at the time i had a beyerdynamic t st gen and a bottlehead crack with the speedball mod lol if you click on the hyperlink for the crack my setup was janky af alright i’m being an asshole since that is a pretty solid setup but what i mean to say is that outside of that i don’t really know much about headphones enough to hold a conversation about them well i probably did but you know s o c i a l a n x i e t y this event really allowed me to try headphones i don’t think i would ever get to try ever like yo some of these setups were like a few grand and i’m just handling the gear awkwardly like a pubescent teen who grew too fast and has to learn how to walk again without tripping over their feet things stood out to me from that meet the hifiman he with dcamrspeakers alpha pads campfire audio andromeda legit teared up a little listening with them and the grado ps now the first were amazing but the grado was horrible lmao ok so forget the obvious “grado are treble cannon hurrdurr” for now did you know that they weigh around grams the sr is less than half that the ps is so unnecessarily heavy and it’s all because of its metal earcups if you thought the woodenplastic grados were uncomfortable ohhh let me tell you sumthin it only gets worse the higher you climb well more like the lower you climb since i think the sre sounds better than the ps but hey that’s just me and most other people who’ve heard both fast forward to a year or later i bought myself my own andromeda though i’ve now sold them fast forward to early i bought myself an og he alright let me tell yall somethin’ back in my day you can get an og he for well under a grand alright alright nowadays you can barely find a pair for less than now i don’t wanna go around pointin’ fingers but uhm dem newly tik tak youtube schmootube hypebeasts dun ruined my chances of gettin’ another pair for a reasonable puhrice alright i’m kidding sorta i’m just bitter i sold my he before prices really soared lmao well you’re probably thinking “feilong if you really liked the he that much why did you sell them” well let me tell you this alright huddle up come in close now don’t be shy i had just bought a susvara and i could really use the funds to recuperate actually this would be my rd year of owning the susvara i just checked the invoice and it was on november th in and that also means that my warranty’s over lmao let me tell you something though the susvara looks around they really helped me through like i know it was rough for everybody but man did the susvara help bro i turned that susvara into the most used susvara in existence or at least so i thought i had to send them in for warranty because there was a channel imbalance developing it was my bad it was just my custom cable going bad so i didn’t know that they send refurb units as replacements well maybe that’s the norm and i just didn’t know maybe klipsch sent me a refurbed s who knows i mean hell god forbid if they sold it as new but it was actually a refurb right micca i’m kidding water under the bridge but test me and imma turn that bridge into venice italy alright but as i was saying the unit hifiman sent me was in worse condition than the one i sent in and i dailied the hell out of my susvara to be honest i was pretty impressed so for context it was roughly just months ago since i first sent them in so i’ve dailied mine for over years so this unit they sent me right yo the headband strap was sooo used that it was flopping around like my betta fish when it jumped out of its tank my headband never did that like i said i’m actually impressed or maybe i should feel defeated i don’t know i’m not quite sure how to feel i’ve already selfcongratulated myself for being the owner of the most used susvara but it turns out that someone’s had me beat but actually now that i think about it besides the athms the susvara is the only headphone i’ve held onto the longest i’m not a loyal ho i’m sorry chris brown but i like to sleep around i feel like i’ve been chasing the metaphorical audio dragon for the longest time and i’ve found it with the susvara so i guess what i’m trying to say is will you marry me hifiman susvara we’ve been with each other through thick and thin and i’ve cut ties with all the side bitches ayo shush hds i was just playing around witchu it was nothin’ serious i’m proposing here and i can’t picture my life without you so please say yes make me the happiest headphone enthusiast there ever was … … … yes ohh susvara muah muah muah ohh im so happy everybody’s invited to the wedding except you uncle tim you know what you did you goddamned animal alright so i’ll be submitting this as a paper if i ever go back to college and i’ll probably land myself in the psych ward thanks for reading my essay happy th of july oh shoot i forgot to mention what iems i use now well i don’t really get the opportunity to iems anymore so i just have a sony mh my favorite is currently the audio ut i’ve bought and sold them twice since uhhhhhh they expensive i might just get another pair and finally be at my end game or at least until the next best thing i dunno man im already married to susvara i wouldn’t cheat wait but i’m not a loyal ho hmmm… well if hifiman decides to drop the amongusvara my eyes may start wandering look i dont know what the tik tak kids are into nowadays i’ve never even played amongus is that even what the game is called i’m sorry i left my novel here on a cliffhanger will i cheat on my susvara if something better drops probably not since my wallet won’t allow it wait no thatll be the takeaway for this essay “sorry about your wallet” yeah no i don’t have words of advice being years in why did i even write this i dont know bro im going to sleep byee i woke up and realized i forgot to talk about my vintage headphones phase i mean i’m technically still in it but i’m only really keeping an eye out for a few pairs that evade me and my modded fostex tv that i sold if you know who has it please let me know i sold it to a guy who sold them on ebay so i have no idea who has them now but during this phase i learned how to solder diy and tune headphones i got into headphone measurements as well it’s just a minidsp ears but it’s helped me notice patterns with certain materials dampening techniques and earpads i think this is when i had the most fun and growth in the hobby i was able to successfully if i may say that an openback headphone sorta from scratch i used mm peerless drivers and an audio technica athad chassis i believe i used dekoni’s elite velour beyerdynamic earpads on them i made many revisions mostly focusing on the paper baffle dampening where i learned that the density makes a huge difference here’s the measurement for them in case you were interested i sold it to a guy locally and i kinda want them back now lol just so i can replicate it again to have another pair in my collection yeah i might just do that attempt to make another one that is other than that what other plans do i have for this hobby i don’t know i’m content with what i have maybe just get some wireless buds for going out and about you know what that’s the takeaway just buy some wireless earphones and get out of this hobby while you still can stay ignorant thank you if you’ve actually read this whole thing why did you do that uhh i guess i should turn it around and ask how long have you been in the hobby are you in it for the headphones the music or maybe something else what keeps it interesting for you,edit alright format looked lot better google docs nightmare reddit ill link well oh shit wrote novel google docs says pages alright writing note written everything uhh proceed risk sleep typing morning please take seriously hope least gotten chuckle outta attempt read uhhhhh tldr read good big kahuna big boy ben year would mark th year hobby personal audio collecting headphones say collecting headphones really buying selling whole bunch gear care celebrating whole numbers

vintage headphones mention case wondering may takeaway someone year experience hobby mean even know writing going along see try talk noteworthy headphones journey reference list headphones owned longer think headphones earphonesiems owned past years made list years might forgotten entries chronological order though start audio technica athms well technically started pair beats dre studio remember seeing people wear school thinking coolest headphones ever mind st version cheap plastic use aa batteries power mean dr dre brainchild good remember going target best buy many times try kiosks like yooooooo headphones sooo good bass loud cracked finally bought pair fake ones even imagine spending dollars pair headphones think tyll innerfidelity said written monster dr dre really pushed norm spending headphones masses agree close broke chose next best thing lol wellllll none wiser remember using fake beats watched toradora anime entirety one sitting yes episodes one sides

coming up with rhymes in my head so by the time i got to where i had to go to lay it down i had already memorized it greg okay i’m from the bronx as well considering that we started this it’s a shame that we haven’t really been popping since big pun was here why do you think we fell off so hard rell i don’t know what it is bronx niggas is always used for something else if a harlem nigga is getting money the bronx nigga is the enforcer—he’s the goon we’ve never been on some rap shit like we been on our real gorilla shit now there’s a lot of talent coming up in the bronx like i be in the hoods a lot of young niggas that’s fire in the bronx your boy hell rell is definitely taking us to the top shout out to joe i don’t really know homie but he ain’t really holding down the bronx like that—no

avenue in the bronx jim used to live in in the bronx so i knew that nigga before he moved to harlem and started his harlem thing so we basically knew each other we all traveled in the same circles greg what were you arrested for rell i got caught with grams in a fiends apartment i actually made a sale in the fiend’s apartment undercovers came and kicked the apartment in they charged the crackhead with the grams because it was her apartment greg how was your time in prison rell i was hotter than some niggas that was out there with a deal no disrespect to gunit but we started that mixtape shit like when the first diplomat mixtape came out we had the streets on fire when cam first signed to the roc in i was featured on the diplomats volume i was incarcerated at the time i remember i had spit freestyles while i was in rikers island you had a bunch of hating ass niggas in there though jim took care of me when i was in i stayed on the visiting floor i had packages i was fresh to death i had jewelry and i kept the weed i was the weed man all them niggas in jail do is read magazines and watch videos so every magazine the diplomats appeared in they shouted me out so niggas would be jealous because they knew i had something to come home to a lot of niggas in jail be miserable because they have to go back to being on the corner or go back to being broke i was a made man i had that hate but i came home without a scar on my face so it’s nothing greg did they try to test you because of that rell yeah i ain’t special it wasn’t like “oh he hell rell leave him alone” there were a couple of niggas that tried to come at me greg was there anybody else famous that you bumped into while you were in rell i actually bumped into shyne in clinton shout out to po—get home my nigga when i was there po was good he was going onto the visiting floor russell simmons came to see him when i was there—that’s when he worked out his def jam deal i only seen him one time i wrote him one letter he wrote me one letter but that was on the strength that he knew who i was and i knew who he was chi ali was there too he got to life he was my nigga too greg flipping the jail time into a positive – how was your homecoming rell my homecoming was retarded b greg let’s get into it rell i came home august th friday the th so i thought i was going to get hit by a bus a train or stuck by lightning a nigga coming home on friday the th that’s a bad luck day i didn’t speak to cam two weeks prior to me coming home greg what joint you came home from rell when you get released from jail they give you a state id that’s valid for days a check for whatever is in your bank account you get an account when you locked up i came home with in my account they give you a pair of state greens and allstar converses so i got on the state greens i didn’t have nobody to send up my clothes over because my niggas picking me up i was coming home with two other niggas and they stunted on me like “i thought you were dipset nigga where ya mans at now” so we standing at the at the greyhound bus station and i’m thinking i got to go home on the bus next thing you know my boy pulls out with the stretch white excursion cam hops out with two tennis chains on his neck takes two of them off puts them on my neck and gives me a stack of all in hundreds a big ass knot the size of an xbox he put it in my hand and said “welcome home my nigga let’s get rich greg what happened when you got back to the city rell soon as i got to the city killa said “what you want to do you want to go shopping you

ui1716,Incognito Model Contest | Week 3 Judgement Day,man of the shadows narrator after receiving their lecture about their first side mission and short briefing on the photoshoot the models were escorted back to their quarters they knew not to rest too much or get too comfortable because judgment day was upon themmeaning that afternoon they had a good hour or two to relax so the ladies went about allotting their time in different ways some slept some gamed yes the facility has video games and some wanted to shower dip into the pool or hit the sauna jan found herself in the steamy sauna trying to practice selfreflection and contemplate about her past actions she understood what needed to be done to get out of that party yet she cannot help but think shooting harley the trickster was the wrong play and she could have showed more restraint thats what one side of her head is thinking while the other side completely disagrees her more rational side knows that it was the only way they were getting out alive she rests her head on the wood panels behind her stressed and tired from all her thinking she closes her eyes and tries to just relax saunas are supposed to be relaxing and she only had an hour left to start doing so she hears someone come into the sauna but doesnt bother to look a few seconds later she turns to her right and blesnya is sitting next to her shes a bit startled but relieved to see a friendly face blesnya came to lessen the pain of carrying a heavy burden the challenge penalty blesnya was doing so well in the past but now shes fallen among the ranks and fears she might not be off this slippery downwards slope yet both try to just close their eyes and forget for a few moments trying desperately to clear their heads of their stressors and relax much to their surprise a few moments later most of the girls are now in the sauna jan and blesnya roll their eyes with such aggravation at how crowded the room has become their quiet destressing chamber was now crowded with a bunch of women who came to ruin their houror thats what they thought but each girl came into the sauna for a different reasonto alleviate a certain stressor rania is the instagram model with the instagram look she wants to be well respected amongst the other girls but shes constantly casted aside she has some friends sure but she knows no one thinks shes hot shit unless its to impress the gram now that yumi is gone rania feels her support system is slowly vanishing and her confidence with it mika and zhenya find that they look very similar similar looks they must be blind lmao similar markets and even similar heights and respectively they are each others competition and try to standout the only issuethey are joined to the hip they are the best of friends and just cant stand the possibility of outshining the other girl they really arent ready for the next brief then if both stay im just saying eniola just got finished crying in the corner so nothing new there alexandra can honestly not give a shit after the terrors of bootcamp so shes trying to overcome that trauma and revitalize her love for fashion and modeling hopefully she can show she cared in her photo this week she thinks to herself then we have ms ebony and ms ivory aya and barbara they both have been hitting it out of the park earlier on consistently amongst the top ranks but both have taken a fallsome heavier than otherswith this recent challenge they are two of the fiercest competitors and love to compete so they are taking these failures personally maybe they shined in this weeks photoshoot aya doesnt seem to think so barbara is trying to comfort her but she reminds herself that shes in it to win it too and needs to think of herself in the process hyunji fran luz and frida all came in with nerves and excitement rushing through their veins they are still riding that high from the heist something most of them crave except hyunji even though she bitchslapped that woman shes trying so hard to forget how vulnerable and helpless she felt in the moment if it wasnt for luz and frida creating all that commotion so she could escape she doesnt know what her next move would have been shes spiraling in a sea of uncertainty and now cant seem to think straight frans laughing in a corner remembering her epic tag team with jan from calling the cops to jan shooting harley the trickster shes elated by the entire experience luz doesnt recall doing much but carefully deactivating the glass the rose lenses were encased in shes already dabbled in a bit of hacking in the past so getting to put some of it to use was satisfying frida was the one who actually took the lenses and presented them to agent y which consequentially crowned her as the challenge winner and with that sweet advantage of swapping above the model she places below if she isnt called first has her anticipating her name being called first for a third time now shes big on competition and thinks she rocked the recent photoshoot all the models are in there for their own different reasons but they all came to do one thing relax simultaneously they all breathe in and exhale a sigh of comfort and relaxation they have finally achieved what they have come to do and it feels great all of them giggle from how coincidentally synced their sighs were they havent felt as united ever until this day and it seems to be a good feeling all around intercom all models are to be ready and escorted down to the hall of masks in minutes for judgement day a room full of laughter and tranquility was just interrupted and these models are pissed every single one of them looked at each other and rolled their eyes in annoyance duty calls they guess now the quarter is in mayhem as they remember that director j isnt one to fuck around with so them taking an extra five minutes to bitch groan and be upset about the recent announcement wasnt a smart decision so they all frantically leave the sauna and rush to get changed they have minutes now to get ready hopefully they make it in time fast foward to the hall of masks director j i am very pleased to see all of you some of you look lovely while others are still putting on shshoes yall had two hours to get ready so how are half of you not rea you know what never mind that for now we have to get down to business today is judgement day as you all know and its time to make another cut and another maiden for this facility i genuinely feel awful for however leaves next because youll be assigned to the waste sector because you are trash the models are put down by that remark anxiety and angst are rising amongst the ladies fearing for working in the waste sectorknown to have a rat infestation maggots and mold engulf the area and it handles all the filthiness that the facility outputs which is rough trust me that was a bit out of character my apologies but what i said was true you will be assigned to the waste sector following your elimination how tragic director j apologies before judgment day can properly commence director j turns to agent y so she can give her unhinged commentary to his surprise agent y isnt in her seat director j is both confused and enraged that she hasnt shown up meanwhile agent y is in her dressing room eating chocolate covered strawberries and watching sex and the city she seems to be tired after bootcamp so shes calling it a night off director j immediately tries to get agent y on the phone so she can make her way down and hopefully not embarrass him further all the panels judgement days are livestreamed for spectators sponsors and clients to watch most of them enjoy the broadcast but many are there specifically to stay updated on what the two most infamous models in the industry and criminals in the shadow industry where the dark web and market lies are doing weekly people tune in to make bets scout out potential models for when everything ends and sponsor the facility off of pure entertainment the presence of both hosts is imperative to the success and longevity of the facility so when i say director j is enraged he has brought hell on earth the room stands still for a second as the phone rings it rings once then twice then three times on the fourth time the line is picked up ahahahaa whats up director j agent y asks while munching on a strawberry director j tries to practice restraint and whispers where the fuck are you agent y judgement day has commenced and you are not in attendance you know how dangerous this is for our empire dont you yeah but im too tired today after bootcamp those models have learned to endure my exercises and im pooped so imma just chill out here for the rest of the night agent y replies with a nonchalant attitude you will do no such thing you will hello hello director j responds but is unfortunately cut off because the line has disconnected alexandra who usually doesnt care about anything is screaming in the corner at this entire spectacle some of the other ladies are rolling in their chairs too following alexs lead they are all met with the most frightening and daunting soulpiercing stare from director j who almost must take off his mask to reintroduce his fuming head to fresh air director j okay okay its all fine we will just skip the commentary and move straight onto results this week you all were featured on shadow m magazine and successfullyfor the most partwent unnoticed as convincing enough men but pierre knew a few of you were women so well find out shortly who failed to disguise themselves properly director j announces first up i have luz congratulations you are becoming a threat in this competition and if the ladies behind havent gotten nervous yet they need to plan to do so soon next name i have listed is fran congratulations as bland as oatmeal without sugar for the past week but you have redeemed yourself with both this cover and your drag queen photo the second runnerup for this week goes to alexandra marvelous job ill be quite honest i never foresaw this transpiring these spectators arent feeling you until you gave me this it still has that nonchalant i couldnt care less look to it but youve finally found the right place to showcase that also a bw cover will always be hot so you were well off from the start next in a row i have aya jumping up from that bottom three placement in the challenge i see rania continuing to prove to us that the gram isnt your limit and jan i was very impressed with what you did at the event and whether you cant sit with it or not you made me very proud so proud that i expected to see you near the top for the sheer badassery you displayed in the challenge but sometimes it takes more than that so nice try jan following them i have barbara zhenya and blesnya who both tied to break that tie i factored in your challenge penalty blesnya so you placed right below zhenya even though zhenya didnt place below you i thought it was a fitting way to settle the tie this next name has disappointed me tremendously this week and that is frida girl did you not just win the challenge how are you placing th at a photoshoot and you didnt even get th initially you placed th so in the bottom three that challenge win really came in handy cause you were two steps away from cleaning the waste sector also blesnyaour challenge loserplaced above you even with her penalty applied now thats embarrassing the penultimate name did not even deserve to be here and got screwed over by a fellow model and that is hyunji i know what you experienced at the mission was scary ive been caught in the same situation myself you dont know what to do the plan is crumbling and there is no next move because you are moving in a circle i commend you for keeping your cool though and youre doing an even better job standing before me here than at that mission keep that talent itll help you tremendously in the future hyunji congratulations i have one final name listed eniola and mika please step up for me immediately one of you was part of the fools who was caught at the missiona simple one at that and both of you were caught at the photoshoot failures is what you two are one of you failed worse than the other and weirdly thats who remains tonight congratulations mika eniola falls to her knees in tears after hearing the news mika is feeling awful after being told she failed twice in a single week moments after eniola is escorted to the waste sector mika and the rest of the girls are standing there in relief as they watch her leave thankful that it hadnt been them director j you are all dismissed have a good night,man shadows narrator receiving lecture first side mission short briefing photoshoot models escorted back quarters knew rest much get

tn99dd,I’m just so tired of it all. Also if you have tips to get through drivers Ed with Adhd please help a non-binary out.,i often have this feeling that my family is willing to accept or acknowledge that i’m dyslexic or have adhdautism but aren’t willing to realize what that comes with those words i am for instance when my school recognized that i have dyslexia my family began to make really frequent jokes about it and i hated it but their justification was that it’s a part of me and that i need to get over it the issue i have is we wouldn’t make the same kind of jokes about my twin brother with spina bifida we don’t talk to my brother about how “that’s not a task you understand cause you can’t walk” in the same way that i can spell just not well he can walk it’s so demeaning when they make jokes about banana grams and how that would be a terrible activity for me or when they spell something around me and say that it’s the wrong crowd it’s like i’m stupid but i’m not there’s a reason it took them grades to diagnose me i’m a grade ahead in math and science and have nearly always been in the advanced groupclass for reading i was officially labeled as gt in second grade so when they treat me like i’m stupid and can’t understand words it makes me feel less then human now on to the main topic i’m currently taking an online drivers education course and am finding it extremely difficult to get through it’s not that i’m finding the content of the course to be something that i don’t get and i’m passing the little quizzes at the end of each section with flying colors but they have these stupid timed sections that make it impossible to stay focused on the actual course i under stand that they have to make it last hours but if they instead of just putting the most basic information about driving in there and they put information to fill up the space it may not be so bad but no they don’t do that so i have had extreme difficulty trying to finish drivers ed and my family is badgering me to get it done but that’s not really what i’m taking issue with my step dad often the ass hole is trying to bully me into getting it done and completely ignoring why it might be so hard for me to get it done i can’t explain to him why it’s so hard because then it’s an excuse and it’s not anything that might get me to do it but instead of trying to understand why it’s so hard he compares me to my twin brother who doesn’t have learning disabilities and can’t understand why we’re so different now the drivers ed isnt the only example of this but this is getting long imma end this here but if y’all fellow kids are willing to hear my other issues and try and offer me advice on this or any other post i make please tell me,often feeling family willing accept acknowledge dyslexic adhdautism willing realize comes words instance school recognized dyslexia family began make really frequent jokes hated justification part need get issue make kind jokes twin brother spina bifida talk brother task understand cause walk way spell well walk demeaning make jokes banana grams would terrible activity spell something around say wrong crowd like stupid reason took grades diagnose grade ahead math science nearly always advanced groupclass reading officially labeled gt second grade treat like stupid understand words makes feel less human main topic currently taking online drivers education course finding extremely difficult get finding content course something get passing little quizzes end section flying colors stupid timed sections make impossible stay focused actual course stand make last hours instead putting basic information driving put information fill space may bad extreme difficulty trying finish drivers ed family badgering get done really taking issue step dad often ass hole trying bully getting done completely ignoring might hard get done explain hard excuse anything might get instead trying understand hard compares twin brother learning disabilities understand different drivers ed isnt example getting long imma end fellow kids willing hear issues try offer advice post make please tell

qefc59,my current theory on murder drones with the trailer + 2 clips.,this will be a theory and noticing little funny details i will state the theories i have currently and then in the end i will say all the little details i saw that made me laugh a little so i think that everyone gets the idea that they are worker drones and daddymommy drones i will call them parent drones or murder drones but i just wanted to add that in lol planet goes boom and murder drones didnt exactly like the idea or run away ai at this point i think i have an idea of why the worker drones are being slaughtered they are autonomous robots helping humans mine exoplanets so here is when i think that there prime programming was to work for humans to mine the exoplanet of resources humans fk up no surprise there and planet goes boom worker drones have nothing to do and can finally live their lives effectively being run away ai in the eyes of the parent company because they are not doing their job as for the spire of corpses i think this was is used as a warning to run away ai the murder drones would hunt down them and then pile them up for a warning for anyone else wanting to try this only problem is that the worker drones have no humans to control them and then a glitch happens in the system for the parent company and the murder drones are sent down to kill anything that moves creating what was once a pile into a spire who knew that murderous drones have a talent in art if u dont include killing as an art now i get onto n in this theory i think ns role in this series will be that he is the balance between the sides he is going to experience what it is like to be a worker drone and uzi will see how n gets treated by his co workers i will explain the clip with n in later the one on the glitch channel n will ultimately say something like these worker drones are not run away ai they have no purpose and our company hasnt assigned them anything to do my final main point on this trailer is the pic i sent yesterday the one with n having full lights on his head band and one eye in an x while the other is normal from what we have gathered the x only appears for when they have a lock on target so here my thoughts are that he is trying to fight between sides the worker drone side and the murder drone side n understands at this point the problem the worker drones have but at the same time wants to impress v by killing uzi because she has that all powerful plot armour as he say when locking onto her a small side point to mention is the end shot with the missiles they look heat sinking with the red flare like tip but idk anything about missiles so imma bullshit my way through here on one hand the heat sinking missiles would be smart because they are in a frozen wasteland so heat signatures will pick up ezier on the other hand humans have heat signatures what is to stop one of them to previously lock onto a run away ai and switch to a human wait that would imply that the worker drones have heat signatures what use would that provide idk lol moving onto the the first clip ns house things in here that i have questions about i have way more things i noticed when first watching buuuuut will say those at the end first is the green cylinder and second is the red light in the head band the green cylinder tgc obviously has a fk ton of power behind it but my question is who built that cylinder because they were previously worker drones so no time for making special ammo for weapons and had a short amount of time to make it my second question is how did it get at ns house or was uzi looking for something else there and found that idk second point is the red light it obviously means something so throughout the series i will be watching out for this maybe we get a red light in a different place or we get multiple red lights but for what causes a red light so far is a railgun shot straight to the head and it doesnt even kill them cmon rly before uzi slaps n with an arm we see optic sensors offline what i dont get here is that it just says that n looks unconscious or at least in a power down state and his optic sensors also effect his conscious state if it was just optics he would most likely be panicked as he cant see what is in front of him but i digress the red headband my theory as of now is that each light has a role to play in the programme maybe one is for speech another is for memories the other is the murderous intent for all worker drones on planet earth when all are on it spells disaster for the worker drones now for the meet the team clip not much to say really here theory wise all we get is info that n has a crush for v and j is the leader only thing i can add here is what do the serial designations mean if they do is there a reason why someone gets v and another gets j time will tell for this so my theory on the plot line given what we have so far we start out with uzi living a normal autonomous life and working for the humans humans fk up and boom all the worker drones have nothing to do with humans and create their own life a glitch happens within the parent companies system and sends out murder drones to kill on sight for all the worker drones we get introduced to n and he acts like the balancemid point of the sides n walks a mile in uzis shoes and uzi sees how every other murder drones treats n many things happen down the line and n has his moment of choose your side with uzi and v we will get an explanation of who gets what serial designation i will laugh if i get this right still reading wow i am surprised sorry for making you read all this so now i will go over things i noticed at least a second time watching mostly as well a comedy things usually in backgrounds staring right off is the opening shot of the trailer they sleep by getting charged up by the power outlet next to uzi this makes me laugh but on the other hand it actually makes sense when you think about it next is at in the trailer seems innocent right wrong look at the bottom right a poor guy was killed in the grinder to make things worse is the worker drones still working with that in front of them all just for icing on the cake one of the human works literally takes a pic of his corpse what is he gonna do post it on the gram with the captions nearly died at work today lmao at they take some gratification in smashing frozen human remains now we all laugh at the guys shrugging their shoulders as the planet goes boom but no one talks about the guys walking in the back feeling happy proud of themselves idk the word for this but imagine feeling proud of something you did and second later u find urself dead calling that those in that shot r twins right before v is ripping someone apart she uses her wings as weapons so they aint just for flight it seems v is in the background firing the missiles v kicks away the railgun how i think i know it is v is because ns feet look like boots whereas the others have stilt like limbs for legs no foot or boot is on the bottom now moving onto ns house i have so many funny rage things here damm that was a strong throwing arm i wonder if u may need that arm later tho hmmmmm then literally after this we see uzi pick up the green cylinder no uncovering of it just found it on the floor and picks it up why this matters because would you pick up the junk first before u pick up what u came for where did u get that glass shard and how is it so perfectly formed in a pentagon shape the lines are just too smooth for me smile and wave n smile and wave that took u seconds to reload the weapon when i am pretty sure u should of been dead in half a second by n guess he is useless and does a terrible job i am sorry but for the looks of the gun and how much snow is displaced when the railgun hits the floor it just feels like a plastic toy gun or is this just me she is clearly rolling from how n threw her but cmon he back would hit the generator and not her head first especially in the up right position little sus ngl damm that acid isnt for show but how do they make the acid in the first place is it from drinking oil plot armour detected nice its a fking railgun series worst animation ever created reason is that uzi doesnt have an uzi its like naming pistols which would be better name pistols car and nage or same thing with the names car and rot at least make it stand out a little but at least it killed the murder drone suck on that dad i have several questions rn so many that i dont even wanna say them all because this is getting long as it is ffs the plot armour is really showing because that arm wasnt there when uzi threw it but it magically appears murder drones takes the slap but wouldnt it be better to hit it with the but of the gun my only thing to mention in meet the team is how the water effects at the start feel off sounds like it was in a cave idk thats just me so in case u r one of those people myself included who just scroll to the bottom here is my main theory we start out with uzi living a normal autonomous life and working for the humans humans fk up and boom all the worker drones have nothing to do with humans and create their own life a glitch happens within the parent companies system and sends out murder drones to kill on sight for all the worker drones we get introduced to n and he acts like the balancemid point of the sides n walks a mile in uzis shoes and uzi sees how every other murder drones treats n many things happen down the line and n has his moment of choose your side with uzi and v we will get an explanation of who gets what serial designation i will laugh if i get this right but thats just a theory a dom theory thx for reading,theory noticing little funny details state theories currently end say little details saw made laugh little think everyone gets idea worker drones daddymommy drones call parent drones murder drones wanted add lol planet goes boom murder drones didnt exactly like idea run away ai point think idea worker drones slaughtered autonomous robots helping humans mine exoplanets think prime programming work humans mine exoplanet resources humans fk surprise planet goes boom worker drones nothing finally live lives effectively run away ai eyes parent company job spire corpses think used warning run away ai murder drones would hunt pile warning anyone else wanting try problem worker drones humans control glitch happens system parent company murder drones sent kill anything moves creating pile spire knew murderous drones talent art dont include killing art get onto theory think ns role series balance sides going experience like worker drone uzi see gets treated co workers explain clip later one glitch channel ultimately say something like worker drones run away ai purpose company hasnt assigned anything final main point trailer pic sent yesterday one full lights head band one eye normal gathered appears lock target thoughts trying fight sides worker drone side murder drone side understands point problem worker drones time wants impress killing uzi powerful plot armour say locking onto small side point mention end shot missiles look heat sinking red flare like tip idk anything missiles imma bullshit way one hand heat sinking missiles would smart frozen wasteland heat signatures pick ezier hand humans heat signatures stop one previously lock onto run away ai switch human wait would imply worker drones heat signatures use would provide idk lol moving onto first clip ns house things questions way things noticed first watching buuuuut say end first green cylinder second red light head band green cylinder tgc obviously fk ton power behind question built cylinder previously worker drones time making special ammo weapons short amount time make second question get ns house uzi looking something else found idk second point red light obviously means something throughout series watching maybe get red light different place get multiple red lights causes red light far railgun shot straight head doesnt even kill cmon rly uzi slaps arm see optic sensors offline dont get says looks unconscious least power state optic sensors also effect conscious state optics would likely panicked cant see front digress red headband theory light role play programme maybe one speech another memories murderous intent worker drones planet earth spells disaster worker drones meet team clip much say really theory wise get info crush leader thing add serial designations mean reason someone gets another gets time tell theory plot line given far start uzi living normal autonomous life working humans humans fk boom worker drones nothing humans create life glitch happens within parent companies system sends murder drones kill sight worker drones get introduced acts like balancemid point sides walks mile uzis shoes uzi sees every murder drones treats many things happen line moment choose side uzi get explanation gets serial designation laugh get right still reading wow surprised sorry making read go things noticed least second time watching mostly well comedy things usually backgrounds staring right opening shot trailer sleep getting charged power outlet next uzi makes laugh hand actually makes sense think next trailer seems innocent right wrong look bottom right poor guy killed grinder make things worse worker drones still working front icing cake one human works literally takes pic corpse gon na post gram captions nearly died work today lmao take gratification smashing frozen human remains laugh guys shrugging shoulders planet goes boom one talks guys walking back feeling happy proud idk word imagine feeling proud something second later find urself dead calling shot twins right ripping someone apart uses wings weapons aint flight seems background firing missiles kicks away railgun think know ns feet look like boots whereas others stilt like limbs legs foot boot bottom moving onto ns house many funny rage things damm strong throwing arm wonder may need arm later tho hmmmmm literally see uzi pick green cylinder uncovering found floor picks matters would pick junk first pick came get glass shard perfectly formed pentagon shape lines smooth smile wave smile wave took seconds reload weapon pretty sure dead half second guess useless terrible job sorry looks gun much snow displaced railgun hits floor feels like plastic toy gun clearly rolling threw cmon back would hit generator head first especially right position little sus ngl damm acid isnt show make acid first place drinking oil plot armour detected nice fking railgun series worst animation ever created reason uzi doesnt uzi like naming pistols would better name pistols car nage thing names car rot least make stand little least killed murder drone suck dad several questions rn many dont even wan na say getting long ffs plot armour really showing arm wasnt uzi threw magically appears murder drones takes slap wouldnt better hit gun thing mention meet team water effects start feel sounds like cave idk thats case one people included scroll bottom main theory start uzi living normal autonomous life working humans humans fk boom worker drones nothing humans create life glitch happens within parent companies system sends murder drones kill sight worker drones get introduced acts like balancemid point sides walks mile uzis shoes uzi sees every murder drones treats many things happen line moment choose side uzi get explanation gets serial designation laugh get right thats theory dom theory thx reading
p27v60,24 [M4F] NYC/Long Island (EST Times) - Kinda bankin on being thorough + honest to cook somethin up here so buckle up for a longboi,hi i don’t wanna waste anyone’s time so if you won’t be comfortable verifying skip this post i’ll ofc gladly do the same 🙂 this is my attempt to make sure that if i end up getting bamboozled it’s by only exceptionally gifted catfishesbots in which case they’ll have earned my begrudging respect not sure she’s out here but here’s hopin 🤞🏽 what i’m looking for someone around my age to chat upbanter with again i’ve been single since i miss the excitement of having a somebody this can get as cerebral as discussing cultural perspectives on society or as goofy as just straight up roasting each other affectionately ofc if all’s going well we’ll prob end up doing a bit of both anyway swapping stories sharing victoriesetc dming vid calls voice messages — it’s all fair game each has its uses preferred ages feel a little too young tbh but i’m open to being proven wrong i’m a grad student what i lack in “having my own place” i make up for so say my sources i agree with them in being i a pretty thoughtful dude ii an exceptional communicator iii genuinely interested in cultivating empathy—i love the processes of learning how others experience stuff why people thinkfeel in the ways that they do iv nice to look at v somehow able to bounce between goofy and serious cards on the table i think having a girlfriend or at least being actively in contact with a crush like this makes me more motivatedproductive so tbh that’s my main angle i don’t wanna lead anyone on if we end up becoming a frontpage rr successstory somewhere down the line cool but i’m definitely also good if it organically turns out this only lasts a short while to get through the semester i guess as shallow as it may be the symbiosis of swapping selfies with someone else and hyping each other up on physical appearance it may be needyexternal validationseeking but i think there’s a conversation to be had about it literally let’s talk about it if you feel so inclined i guess i got used to that kind of attention and i haven’t had it in a while i’m talkin stuff like mutual cute smiles “hey look i’m feelin my outfitmakeup” assuming you wear makeup postworkout snaps…etc but hey if we had chemistry and you’re the type of gal who just decides she wants to get a bit more nsfw of her own accord—which i’m only including because oddly enough it has happened to me before lol—then i’d go with the flow this seems important to include historically this stuff doesn’t bother me in the slightest if my girl also doesn’t care but i’m ’ ” ’ ”ish with timbs on 💁🏽‍♀️ i’ve committed more seriously in the last year to fitness mostly as a way to mentallyemotionally cope i was already pretty active tbh and i snap a pic whenever i see a result because documenting progress helps my ego would love flexing these thirst traps on the gram but i just can’t shake the feeling it’d be douchey of me to do even if i slapped a body positive caption on it talking about overcoming my insecuritiesetc so what this means is i have a few pics sitting in a folder that i wistfully sigh at like “why do i have no one to send these to” in the ideal bestcase dream scenario if we end up clicking things progress after some time and she’s also in the nycqueensbrooklynlong island area to link irl i guess that’s why mentioning height may matter lol so i’ll also mention here that i’m brown because i get that even though i don’t some people have such preferences for their own reasons lol i think this info is relevant relationship history—because i want you to know ya boi can hold down a relationship he’s just been choosing lately not to 😤😤 tbh i think i’d be pretty successful on dating apps if i ever used one i just have reasons for not wanting to get on any—though i’m somehow okay with this rr lol i appreciate my past experiences tons year relationship year relationship a messy ish month one in between because there were a lot of truly wonderful moments but the last two in particular were complicated by unhealedongoing trauma my previous girlfriends weren’t coping well with some heavy stuff and it put a lot of strain on everyone involved not their fault they’d been through shit ofc but eventually ya gotta take active ownership of the kind of life you wanna live for whatever it’s worth i def didn’t always get that last bit as much as i do now fortunately both are doing better now—or so i infer just one example i’d like to never find myself in yet another situation where i’m deciding about how much of a danger someone is to themselves so with that said mental health — both yours and mine i take this super seriously and i didn’t always see those last relationships i’m not expecting some unrealistic person with a perfectly unblemished psyche who never has off days as someone who has his fair share that’d be ridiculously unfair of me and supporting each other through lows can be kinda nice sometimes but what i do expect is that you take your own selfcare selfgrowth healing and all that hippie shit really seriously because i do i can’t care about your wellbeing more than you care about your own wellbeing plz no not again if it helps i’m super protherapy which i’ve regularly attended for the last years biggest reason i haven’t been trying to get back into dating since my last one i’m just not willing to date while still living with my parents it’s not just about sex either although ofc that’s part of the reason speaking of sex this only applies for the eventual irl possibility and only if things are actually heating up but it’s good character info to have — i’m fully vaccinated against the rona and superrr into safe sex as in will gladly swap recent std results or even go get tested with you i’m clean tho lol i hear ghosting is one of the worst things about online dating so if it helps any i can guarantee i wouldn’t do that to ya in the absolute worst case i wasn’t feeling it mr krabs i’d directly let you know kindly i’m far enough left on the political spectrum to consider capitalistic greed the root of most modern evil but i’m also a touch more moderate at times than the true lefty left lefties i know working on not being a neolib though imma cap it off here if you wanna give this a shot hit the dms beloved and if ya don’t o redditor no love lost truly sincerely hope you get you yours—whatever that means tell me something about yourself that you wish more people knew or something that you’ve never told someone else slightly petrified that someone i know will come across this but excited enough to ignore that for now,hi wan na waste anyone time comfortable verifying skip post ofc gladly attempt make sure end

o26o6f,"Buy silver - from coins, bars, cutlery and ETFs ...",i already promised that i would try to translate this german thread to english so here comes my first try goal is to give folks an overview what forms of silver they can buy theres more than just the american silver eagle so imma try to give a little overview of the options and my personal opinion silver comes in many forms from bars weighing several pounds to coins cutlery and jewelry to etfs but whats right for you ill note down my thoughts on this topic first of all the basic forms in which we can buy silver xb silver bars xb silver bars bars come in different shapes from very heavy and large kg bars to miniature bars of g large bars have the advantage that they are easy to stack in the case of small bars the surcharge is quickly visible a g silver bar is usually significantly more expensive than a kg bar at the price per gram very small bars ie g and g bars are nicely packaged and appear relatively affordable but if you calculate the price per gram you pay a horrific surcharge for the nice plastic around it and it is sometimes twice the market price the purity is practically exclusively and can therefore also be used for industry without a separation process hence sought after by all sides xb advantages xb for larger bars prices are mostly fair thanks to the shape it can be stacked and stored easily even in larger quantities hardly any surcharge for collectors value apart from a few exceptions practically always pure silver xb disadvantages xb larger bars can usually only be sold through specialist dealers due to their value and demand private individuals avoid buying larger bars because of the risk of counterfeiting and the high price with a few exceptions combi bar a large bar is difficult to divide and must be sold in one piece authenticity is sometimes difficult to determine by the novice xb silver coins xb silver coins there is an endless variety of silver coins the best known is certainly the canadian maple leaf which impresses with its extremely high purity this is followed by classics such as the american silver eagle krugerrand and the vienna philharmonic in addition there are of course an extremely large number of other coins some of which are very well known in addition to the former there are also many coins that are not fine silver ie purest silver commonly used are at least with older coins mostly sterling silver and also silver as the number proves in silver there is only silver these are characterized by a greater hardness and thus better suitability as a commodity in the past you actually had silver coins in your wallet also here in germany during the imperial era in some languages ​​the word silver is still the same as money eg in french argent or in japanese okane coins always have a face value otherwise they are called medals this is now usually lower than the silver price so you do not get these coins at face value but at the silver price plus a small premium the canadian maple leaf has a face value of canadian dollars about euros but for the coin you currently pay euros silver coins in germany had an interesting history until recently until there was a reduced vat rate for coins before a vat rate of applied to silver bars and the reduced rate of to coins which is why silver coins had a slight advantage until at least in the past the german branch also issued silver coins albeit with a face value above the silver price which enabled the coins to be issued at face value the best known and most popular were the euro silver coins from to since these were minted from silver and were issued at a face value of euros these were a foolproof investment because whatever the silver price developed they always were worth euros for a coin that weighs grams it is an impressive grams of silver from the silver content had to be reduced to silver in they had to be discontinued entirely xb xb advantages xb small purchase price an ounce currently around euros smaller quantities can easily be sold wellknown coins such as maple leaf and silver eagle are very easy to sell authenticity of the known coins can be determined with simple means by size weight easy to store xb disadvantages xb inferior euro per gram price than large bars very exotic coins are often only accepted by a specialist dealer after they have been checked partly collectors value surcharge when buying alloys under less popular xb xb jewelry and silverware xb silverware since ancient times there has been jewelry and crockery cutlery made of silver and also various objects of daily use or art objects the best known is probably silver jewelry and grandma’s good silverware cutlery but there are also artistically valuable figures knobs on walking sticks or door handles made of silver the price usually goes beyond the pure value of the alloy caution is advised here as often the only proof of authenticity is a small stamp which varies greatly depending on the manufacturer and age often only a professional can determine whether the silver is the promised because of the shape and nature of the objects a chemical test cannot determine whether the core is made of copper or lead only an elaborate density test can really provide certainty xb xb advantages xb occasionally one can buy silver cutlery and jewelry from novice sellers close to or even below material value xb disadvantages xb many forgeries and silverplated objects on the market authenticity is difficult to verify for a novice may be difficult to sell usually have to pay collectors value practically never silver sometimes a little more difficult to store with large objects xb xb etfs and stocks xb stocks of course there are also etfs and stocks that you can get into your custody account and that are directly or somehow involved in silver the two wellknown etfs are slv and pslv where it really only has to be mentioned that slv is the bigger one in terms of market capitalization and pslv amassing a little more serious physical silver in bulk there are also dozens of stocks from mine operators from small companies on the verge of bankruptcy to major key players in silver mining a little frowned upon among real die hard silver fans paper silver cannot be held and caressed in your hand and in the event of a civil war or power failure it is difficult or impossible to sell nevertheless it is understandable that some of the users also take it into account here whoever has a portfolio anyways may consider whether one should not just include a few etfs or stocks from the silver world if the silver price rises then the value of the will probably rise in the long term mines and etfs xb xb advantages xb very easy to buy and as long as stocks are not totally rare easy to sell storage in your portfolio therefore theoretically without risk no problem with forgeries collectors items or the like value is mostly based strongly on the silver price no extra charge xb disadvantage xb nothing for preppers or doomsday prophets as with all stocks a total failure is unlikely but not impossible see wirecard not suitable for playing with or as a birthday gift xb xb xb conclusion whats best for me if you still have no clue after reading this article i would recommend the canadian silver maple leaf it is the most famous and popular silver coin in the world the silver content is extremely pure the discount compared to exotic coins may be a few cents but in case of doubt you can always get rid of it immediately as no other silver investment object is sought so often thanks to security features current coins are as forgeryproof as a coin can be the unit is very small you can get it for a considerably fair price and already have an ounce if you have more money than scrooge mcduck i can also recommend silver bars ideally a trunk full of kg bars thats where you get the most silver for your money for preppers in europe i recommend the german sterling euro coins whether with silver or euro face value here you have a good chance that in the event of a disaster the idiot from the convenience store next door will sell you a can of beans where do i buy xb trustworthy traders if the local dealer gold jewelry joes coins stamps doesnt have good prices then you can also compare the prices on some websites before you order online read the reviews not only on the website itself also on google and other rating websites no online retailer has a rating there are always idiots who cant even write their address properly or just murphys law and of course most people prefer to rate when they are angry but as long as the good ratings are uptodate and over i would make a small trial order most dealers are also interested in satisfied customers with ebay or classifieds you should be able to check the authenticity yourself many scammers are there and loads of fake goods being sold xb the truth help is everything fake xb no as i said in the previous section reputable dealers do not want counterfeits themselves if you buy coins and are sometimes not entirely convinced of the dealer i recommend the fisch a small no longer cheap plastic tool with which you can recognize all common silver coins forgeries immediately thickness diameter weight plus a small precision balance that is accurate to gram the canadian mint and similar mints will neither cheat you about silver nor give you too much so an ounce should also be grams and not or if the fish is too expensive for you you can also work with a caliper and a precision scale plus a neodymium magnet strangely enough the small magnet slides down slowly on silver while it rolls down like a stone on other nonmagnetic metals take a look at youtube video and you will understand how it works the magnet costs you euros it is also good to have a real reference coin that you can be sure about ie from a wellknown dealer that helps with uncertainties sound test ping test for example for larger purchases it is also worth having chemical tests if you have a very precise balance and enough time you can also do a density test displacement in water but again anyone who buys from renowned retailers wont need to worry,already promised would try translate german thread english comes first try goal give folks overview forms silver buy theres american silver eagle imma try give little overview options personal opinion silver comes many forms bars weighing several pounds coins cutlery jewelry etfs whats right ill note thoughts topic first basic forms buy silver xb silver

nb3zwl,More model pics. HOMAGE TEE. gram gets no love so imma keep posting here too lol,,
n7o8d7,What the hell series in order Part 4,chapter four months out of illic found moral aboard the cresting dawn somewhat lacking though even tzil would admit the bimonthly fight club did add a certain piquancy to getting through the week he had even quietly been working hard in his cabin to get back to his youthful vigor and going so far as to visit the medical unit for a rejuve course though he wasnt really due one for several years in hopes of taking a poke at mccloud himself if he teamed up with zinders and that big hugget who worked in the mess they might have a shot still it could only do so much for the mood of the crew particularly as most didnt know about the bouts or werent interested and the cresting dawns mission was turning out to be a bit of a grind the last nine indicator sites that is locations that had been noted as worth reconnoitering before launch due to some em signal gravitic anomaly or just flat out odd reading picked up by one of the unions probes or out posts had all turned out to be uniformly dull one xray emitting star six high metal systems that tended to reflect external signals in unexpected ways and two nothings as it there was absolutely nothing at the locations they had been directed to the nothings were by far the worse because too union brass thinking something must have given off the signal that their oh so expensive sensors and the even more so computers that interpreted them had found which translated into two weeks cruising in slowly expanding circles searching the local area until everyone was sure absolutely positive there was fuck all to find nor did the food help though any exo ship had rations aboard for the entire expected mission duration and with some to spare it lacked well flavour the standard ration blocks for almost any species due to the tribulations of extended space travel had to fulfill three basic requirements as compact as possible with limited space for over a hundred members of crew it was incumbent on each ration brick they always ended up brick shaped to be as nutrient and energy dense as possible this seemed to mean that no matter what the dietary requirements of the individual crew species each days lot was a grey flat slab about the size of a deck of cards the exception to this rule aboard the crest was one locker that contained the peeq equivalent of gourmet dining for the next six years and around twenty three tons of nutritious clay for grethis which in an effort to save space was currently strapped to the hull between the engine nacelles as universal as possible it made sense that though preferences and tastes may vary widely if a large section of the disparate crew could be fed with the same bricks of basic sugars carbs and protein then that was what was issued as durable as possible it was far easier to stock supplies in unsealed bays while traveling so that no loss of pressure or temperature would have a deleterious effect and of course the risk of pests was far reduced the dawn therefore relied on frequent visits to planets to vary the crews diet and on a small but through hydroponic farm to provide some basic fresh greens after four months though the stocked seafood from illic had long run dry and the farm aboard was still on reduced production repairing damage from the attack had been a priority after engines and hull but plants took time to propagate and grow so as tzil accepted the tasteless paste from the dispenser he considered that though things could of course be worse they could be a damn sight better idly he stroked his spoon through the tacky and oddly stiff food raising peaks and gouging valleys that reminded him of the dramatic vista of his homeland and of course avoiding eating the damn stuff for as long as possible he felt the dawn shudder subtly as it insinuated itself into real space again and glanced at the display on his wrist right on time well two months late but right on time he continued to toy with the goop for a few moments but then remembered that this particular stop was designated for comm drop and with a lighting of spirit wondered if the mail pod that would have been sent to this predesignated location by the union was still waiting on pick up very likely it was not that various scavengers and thieves wouldnt steal a pod if they came across it or that an unmanned one shot pod couldnt go off course but both possibility were vanishingly slim space was very very large and the pods were a simple capsule without an ftl drive or any onboard power system to broadcast their location rather a large tachonic railgun accelerated them to more than ftl speeds and they decayed out into real space at a calculated distance within a given probability at least of course once out they didnt stop and tzil wondered if he would short there it is he felt the ship swing slightly in the dampeners as it banked hard and the sublight thrusters fired as it strove to catch up the pod with the two month head start tzil dumped his tray in the cleanser and headed up to the bridge it would probably take several hours to reach the fleeing capsule but they must have transited fairly close or the captain would simply have engaged the ftl drive and jumped closer entering the bridge he nodded at the helms man and walked over to his seat beside the captain sitting he looked up to the main view and was surprised to see the pod clearly shown he would have expected it to take a while before they caught actual visual sight of it we must have come out close to it sir he remarked denilli looked up at his xo and rasped back very close xo we came out near the far edge of our potential transit cone and the pod must have degraded out prematurely itself were less than six light minutes behind it though our axis of interception is pretty sub optimal still he rapped a few controls and sent a few suggested interception courses to the helm we should be on it in an hour or so tzil was a little perturbed six light minutes may seem like a lot but given the vast void between stars it was something like throwing a dart at a dartboard mccloud had introduced the crew to the human pastime over the size of a stadium and then that dart being hit in mid air by another one thrown from outside the stadium and then both hitting the bullseye it had never occurred to him before that it was a possibility the ship could come out of transit and be actually struck by an inert missile shot from thousands of light years away but within six light minutes was enough to make his feathers bristle ninety minutes later he was down at the rear docking collar with dryig and mccloud as the engineers minutely fettled the engines and the helmsman guided the final approach capture successful he transmitted to the bridge as the locks on the extension arm found purchase on the scarred casing and began to pull it closer confirm capture he heard the captains voice rasp and looking over to dryig he waited a moment as the youlon checked various readouts then nodded affirmative confirmed very well helm will begin deceleration now will confirm when safe to continue confirm bridge the three waited for several minutes as the ship slowed chatting about trifles and the nexts weeks bout insanely the peeq trio aboard had requested a slot to fight mccloud and all three speculated wildly at what the winged micro pachyderms could possibly have planned they were shortly snapped out of the consideration by the captains barking report deceleration complete now safe to bring pod within dampening field understood bridge he nodded at the engineers who had already started to dock the pod xo tzil could hear even through the somewhat indiscriminate translation of the captains voicebox that the tone had changed for a formal one of rote instruction to a more casual conversational one yes sir im off duty shortly unless theres anything urgent in dispatches just hold everything for me till tomorrow will you the unsaid connotation that the captain trusted his senior officers judgement to know what was and wasnt important rang a little pride in tzil of course sir have a good night he turned with the engineers as the pod locked into the docking collar and watched as mccloud ran through a few brief checks pressure holding fine collar good his finger ticked several boxes on the computerised checklist ready to open tzil nodded and the large human popped the hatch and then grasped the door of the pod springing it open and standing as the freezing cold gas inside the capsule flooded out and over him fuck me thats cold the xo and senior engineer exchanged mirthful glances at calums exclamation yeah we usually give it ten minutes to warm up there a heater inside that gets powered through the docking arm he flicked a tentacle at mcclouds ear as the junior retreated dumbass good thing your wearing gloves isnt it or your skin would have stuck to the handle he pocked forward and glanced inside no green bags tzil good anything truly urgent would have been packed in green ill message the storeman to come start unpacking it and with that tapped a few controls on his wrist calum peeked inside i didnt see the last one arrive i believe i was investigating the foul system for that incredibly urgent leak you told me about a sneer crossed his face its half empty you would have thought they could have filled it up with something he withdrew his head food or something seems like a waste one dryig counted off his tentacles you cant send anything organic the tachyons degrade chemical bonds you know that calum shrugged yeah well they could have stuck someth two dryig continued as if not interrupted but with a certain firm edge to his tone every gram of mass included is a gram that has to be accelerated and that takes a vast amount of energy three its more important for the pods to be regular than it is for them to be full and four you never did find that leak still seems wasteful tzil considered that it probably was wasteful to the human his species had had a far more hard scrabble conquest of space than his own or dryigs settling difficult worlds and colonising space stations in mining fields struggling just to house and feed the billions of humans who had increased exponentially with the advent of rejuvenation therapy and life extension if he recalled correctly from their net there were close to a trillion humans now and up until a few short years ago they had been trapped within a few dozen close to earth systems all they could reasonably reach with low ftl he had also been surprised to learn that in fact unsurprisingly the humans hadnt been reasonable and hadnt been found by the union but had actually sent out ten of thousands of ships at low ftl to try and find anything to improve their lot one had then accidentally appeared in the middle of a battle immediately chosen a side and even though hilariously outmatched had actually taken on and beaten a jiko destroyer though at the cost of all but one of the crew after the jiko were routed they had been picked up by the union flagship and made first contact and then instantly asked to join since the admiral that led the fleet felt he had some debt to the lone survivor who had helped turn the battle he had asked his government to sponsor the nascent human application something that often took decades and within a few months the union had a vibrant new member species and the humans had access to the technology to thrive though calum must have learned the new deluge of technology quickly to have qualified for engineer aboard a union ship he had probably spent most of his career in the human fleet running on fumes and scraps tzil considered that if he thought about it he had no idea how old this junior engineer actually was he smiled to himself as he thought about the first question the admiral had asked the first human he had ever seen why and that helmsmans response they fired on a ship clearly venting and out the fight and we thought fuck those guys in particular the second question had perhaps been even better why did you ram it though and the answer had been tzil expected the reason the admiral had fought so hard for their admittance they were putting up little shields and blocking all our shots so we were like parry this you fucking casual and went for them he shook his head ruefully and started up the corridor away from the bickering engineers humans were probably worth having around the mood was lightened considerably for the next few days as the crew chatted about all the news and entertainment they had been sent from home dryig had been particularly chipper as they crossed paths the shipment hadnt just included some very helpful spare parts but also news from home that his fourth generation get had had a clutch of eggs calum had explained about the naming conventions of ancestry in humans and dryig was currently crowing to all and sundry about how he was going to be a grandparent tzil wasnt sure that was quite right but he was happy he had sat down in the mess to eat another unsatisfying meal when looking up he noticed a murmuration ripple through the other crew that gathered glumly and surprisingly quickly a mass exodus followed given any other option he left the bowl of gruel sadly it would remain good for days and followed the trickle of crew as they headed aft as he followed the mass down the long spinal corridor of the dawn a faint scent began to waft through the air the rich greasy smell of cooking protein and when the hatch to the ships bowls opened to accept the ingress of crew ahead he was hit by a thick heavy wave of the smell and drooling he followed entering engineering with the mob he came across hastily set up benches and tables as dryig bustled round placing plates of greasy charred meat in front of everyone who entered and mccloud stood at the back cooking it on what looked very much like an engine manifold moving over to mccloud he asked calum whats all this about and indicated the crowding diners calum turned an slab of the hot flesh and the smell was intoxicating hi xo its a wake of sorts tzil immediately became cold and clammy oh god calum laughed dont worry no booze this time my mate was a muslim he wouldnt have approved muslim one of our religions they dont drink avoid some other stuff too calum shrugged danny was never very staunch but he made his observances faithfully enough im sorry to hear about your friend mccloud tzil consoled was it recent i guess a couple weeks before the mail got sent out so a few months i guess it was in my post from home he turned another slab of meat and painted it with a brush were you very close calum sighed deeply yeah he was like a brother to me we came up in the navy together and he fought beside me in a hundred bar brawls he laughed deeply he started most of them of course used to stand up half cut and scream this whole fucking universe can eat my ass then charge the biggest bloke in the pub angriest man i ever met course five minutes later hed like as not be best mates with the guy and hed be making him laugh so hard the guy he trailed off then shook himself complete arsehole fucking horrendous twisted sense of humour and just the best fucking guy he considered the slabs before him and gave one an inquisitive poke he got vented trying to stop a pressure leak on some shit hole space station saved some lives apparently tzil could feel the movement of the mood to somber but calum quickly snapped out of it he left a note for me asking me to make his dreams come true so i thought id throw a bbq for the crew in his honour got the boys in lab to clone me a load of meat he sent me the code for tzil though he understood calum was one of very few humans that had taken union service and in his own way was an ambassador of the whole race it was entirely understandable that his friends and family might have huge hopes and dreams heaped upon mcclouds broad shoulders if he could succeed so could humanity at large if he could find a place in the greater universe so could they all tzil was brought out of his reverie as mccloud pushed a large plate of the steaming meat into his hands give it a try dont worry i checked its safe for any meat eater aboard tzil began to move off and felt this whole thing was a very fitting tribute to a friend who even now reached out and asked mccloud to build bridges with other species to make bonds of friendship to let all in the union know that they could be valuable not just as a resource but as trusted and caring allies he spotted an empty seat and began to move towards it but turned back for a second to ask what is this again mccloud calum smiled back its called long pig chapter calum found himself oddly nervous as he stood in the brightly illuminated chalk circle he had stood opposite the best brawlers the ship had to offer opposite species with claws teeth one of the computer techs even had poison sacs though evolution had robbed him of the ability to use them effectively but this this was disconcerting hovering at the opposite edge of the circle were the three minute forms that looked for all the world like tiny elephants with tinkerbell wings glued to their backs though closer inspection would also reveal that roughly where you might expect tusks there were in fact little fluffy feelers like a moth actually if he examined very closely and now he peered suspiciously in the harsh glare very closely indeed he could swear that at least two of the diminutive peeq were wearing gold chains round their necks the fuck dryig was standing beside the trio and something they said apparently had put him into fits of laughter calum noticed the rapidly shifting fluid around the youlons middle that indicated a severe case of the giggles in that species consultation apparently ended the senior engineer waved the floating group into the circle mccloud smiled as they trumpeted a challenge we have come to best mccloud on the field of honour the voices were surprisingly human the peeq were some of the most naturally talented linguists in the union we have chosen the ancient form as revealed by our research on humanity the crowd of crewmembers surrounding the circle shivered with confusion and gentle murmuring broke out dryig then hit a couple controls and most of the spotlights switched off plunging the room into darkness apart from two one on calum and one on the peeq we challenge you to a battle a rap battle do you accept or yield and prove us the victors calum felt an old fashioned microphone being pressed into his hand and looking down saw the creased smiling face of dryig picking it up and putting it to his lips hell yeah i do son imma bout to drop some knowledge on your mammoth asses we gotta beat or what he turned to his boss again expecting him to be tapping some wrist controls to get some music but was surprised when one of the peeq started trumpeting a fast tempo apparently they had found out about beat boxing too he grinned broadly and saw one of the trio move forward and raise an identical but microscopic mic to its own mouth youre pink youre tall from above your going bald youre clumsy youre slow and your mother might be a ho it is statistically unlike though calum laughed loudly they definitely had the spirit but might need some more work on the disses you cant beat us youve lost youre nothing but a fool if you think you can stand with the pq crew the peeq floated backwards forcing a serious look on his face calvin brought up the mic and stepped forward i hear a lot of talking i hear a lot of bunk coming for some chumps with elephant trunks he span round and addressed the crowd raising his free hand can you believe this the nerve the cheek thinking they can face me with rhymes so weak he turned back to the crew youve got nothing youre done just three dumb muppets you better watch your ass or ill make you finger puppets he stepped back wiggling his digits in the air the next peeq moved forward thats a lot of noise thats a lot of chatter so were gonna deep fry your head extra batter youre clumsy rhymes cant freak this crew theres nothing your giant pasty ass can do were gonna break you down smash you with damage and we can do it in any language with this he let out an odd warbling squeak that got a bark of laughter from someone hidden in the dark presumably it was in his native tongue calum riposted youre flailing youve rushed and like all other floaters youre gonna get flushed its takes three of you to take on just one little me but youve still no chance cause my rhymes flow free im slick im smooth im golden as butter where you just hang there all a flutter he dropped the mic and stood back crossing his arms the first one flew back in youre right its true its three against you and it weve heard its true too about your little me a tiny little twig on a great big tree calum grasped his chest like hed been hit in the heart its over its done this battle weve won youre thinking ay dios mio cause youve been slapped down by the pq trio as one all three dropped their tiny mics and hung in the air though calum could see them tremble with nerves dryig brought up the lights and stepped into the middle well that was interesting i cant really tell who won so i think were gonna have to ask the expert he turned to calum he shook his head slowly i got served pq crew thrashed me the crowd erupted in cheers and the three peeq whirled together in ecstatic joy dryig turned his face from the crowd and whispered quietly to mccloud dont worry lad i bet heavily on the peeq chapter tzil was not excited as the dawn prepared to drop from ftl it had taken almost three weeks to get to this next indicator site and it had even less of em signature than the two nothings they had recently spent weeks searching still at least this one was approximately in a system they could spend two weeks scanning planets rather than flying in ever increasing circles never anything but professional however he started tapping out the various commands that would alert the captain and the crew that they were about to enter an unknown and potentially hazardous location he checked the various readouts and saw the checks begin to tick off engineering logged on in position as did astrometrics security and he waited for a few moments brow furrowing there they were secondary helm reporting ready he straightened in his seat and peered at the view screen with the countdown to real space ten seconds he buckled himself down as per regulations and flicked a glance up at the hanging emergency atmo mask that had lowered to within easy reach of his outstretched arm all this for fuck he began to shout a command but the reactions of the gelatinous helmsman could not be faulted no sooner had they emerged from transit and the giant ship that was right in front of them appeared looking very solid indeed the helm had pulled hard up and right cut all forward thrust and slammed the emergency nose retros to full in a fraction of a second and with a protoplasmic blur tendrils whipped out and smashed controls as others gripped the yoke and heaved back tzil could feel himself being pulled down in his seat and forward his upper body twisting left and the sensation of millions of little pins being pressed into his skin all over as the dampeners struggled to deal with the massive onslaught of inertia his dully clawed hands dug deeply into the soft arm padding of his chair as the ship yawed wildly the view screen flashing over the other ships hull in a blur of grey and black steel as various hull plates and protuberances sped past it took far longer than it should considering the speed the dawn must still be traveling for the screen to shown the blur of stars rather than metal this ship must be vast but as he stared fixedly tzil could see a wall of towering spires rimming the last edge of the hull open space and safety lay just beyond them he felt the helm fire the aft upper retros and engage the main engine in a frantic effort to pull the ship up but from the feel of the dampeners and the speed at which the towers approached he knew they werent going to make it and the gaps between were definitely not big enough he saw a tendril flick over another control and then pause for a moment as the spire loomed closer oh fuck then it flicked down and even though tzil had clenched his entire body at the sight of the hovering appendage nothing could really prepare you for the feeling of the left upper and the right lower retros firing in concert and the whole ship beginning to corkscrew the helmsman had bet everything on his timing to judge what point of the spin they would hit the gap at there was no quick or easy way to halt the twist once begun inertia demanded payment in full the very metal of the ship flexed and groaned as it was tortured by forces in at least six or seven disparate planes but shuddering as if being smashed by a giants hammer it started to spiral for a few seconds even through the noise even through the shaking there seemed to hang a deathly silence as tzils breath stopped the gap loomed and the dawn spun just before they entered he could see than filore the pathion helmsman had timed it just right with a thousand variables with forces that didnt have time to register on the instruments without the time to read them even if they had at thousands of miles an hour he had taken the feel of the dawn what he knew of the engines even the lag time of the controls and had judged it all to perfection and they still werent going to fit at the very last instant tzil closed his eyes and released himself to the void utterly tranquil that what would be would be this sort of peace had only occurred to him a few times previously in his long life though he knew of several other storkians who had similar experiences during moments of catastrophic stress perhaps it came from being descended of flying ancestors who had found that when plummeting from the sky it was not a good time to freeze or panic instead he took a breath and was ready to hit the ground and then deal with the situation as arose the sound was truly indescribable as metal hit metal so fast that it was at the bleeding edge of contact at least converted directly to plasma the impact was so sudden and at such velocity that even the rapid transit of sound through metal was too slow in the flat dark of his mind tzil felt the forces before he heard the results and like the slow cracking of knuckles could sense when each bank of the dampeners gave out a sharp pop and then increased force another another until he was crammed down and left in the chair he felt a harsh smash of liquid over his upper torso even as the hollow bones in his ribs cracked against the arm of the seat and the ones in his legs flexed and creaked as they bowed completely disassociated from all these physical pains his mind worked with eerie clarity they must have hit to ships topside and begun a compound spin not just sideways from the retros but end over end from the impact the forces came and went in waves as various spins and banks canceled each other out for a fraction of a second the fact that filore or the other helmsman hadnt scrammed the engines to stop the ships acceleration was not a good sign he tried to time the lull but the frequency was increasing he would have to guess before he drove his arm up with all his might and felt the momentary release as he did moving only eight or so inches he found the emergence scram and as the wave retook him he slammed it down suddenly much of the pressure stopped the motion of the ship was still quite noticeable and very nauseating tzil turned his head left and vomited but it no longer pressed him down inertia had been equalised without the engines constant acceleration he opened his eyes and looked up the viewscreen still spun madly and the helmsman was no where to be seen he released his restraints and gripping tightly to consoles and bolted down seats he made his way to the helm and sat the seat was soaking wet he could feel it seep through his uniform and he manually fired micro bursts from retros fortunately the upper forward set were lower down on the dawns hull and had apparently survived with a few bursts from them and a couple on aft lower left he was able to cancel much of the forward spin then he tackled the roll it proved much more difficult as both the upper midship retro sets were either damage or likely simply gone but with a few minutes of careful timing and judicious use of the lowers he tamed much of that as well they were still spinning and floating out of control at high speed but at least movement to start addressing these issues was now possible he hobbled over to the atmospheric and pressure systems console noting as he did that the bridge security officer he thought it might have been sargent jutic lay crumpled against the rooms door a vicious green streak down the metal entry leading to his head he also noted the splash of a light blue fluid over the rear wall and in a moment of insight he put together the wet seat the hot splatter he had felt after impact and the redecoration of the cabins interior ah that was why he couldnt find the helmsman the ameboid crew member had popped he turned and expurgated again then staggered onwards the faint stabbing pain in his chest and the wet in his throat suggesting he had at least ruptured a ballast sac and possibly a lung he gained the console and scanned quickly over the readouts they had lost several of the upper chambers fortunately as the dawn was a converted freighter most of the outer skin was covered in cargo holds that were unpressurised so atmospheric loss was minimal though he could see from some dropping readouts that they had at least a few slow leaks he could also see from the panels that someone else was in the system and rapidly firing instructions to bulkheads to close and reprocessors to funnel and direct air dryig he suspected he tapped a few controls on his wrist dryig this is tzil report he gave himself a shake and tried again bridge to engineering report he saw with dazed confusion that the transmitter light on his wrist was flickering slightly as if he was getting a return but he couldnt hear it bridge to engineering did not copy please retransmit the light flicked again but no sound came through it must be broken he turned and scanned the room and began to move towards the communications main console when the light in the room changed he glanced up to the main viewer and saw a crawl of text engineering here mccloud is safeing systems and reactor is offline have been calling bridge can you hear us it was with a jolt that tzil realised that no he couldnt hear them in fact he couldnt hear anything this room should be screaming with sound but since the impact fuck well add blown eardrums to the list he continued to stare at the screen until the text faded and the outer hull view returned and wondered what the hell he was looking at rather than a ship it seemed to be a vast sheet of steel slightly curved and with one edge flickering with fire as the dawn spun softly it came and went from his view but even though it had been several minutes even though the dawn was still traveling at a tremendous speed he became aware that he was only seeing one corner of the thing the rest faded beyond his view in the distance it must be thousands of miles long what the hell was it and why would anyone build such a thing,chapter four months

kgjs36,Cooking pt3: Alien in the Kitchen,hium yeah this has been a long time coming ive been dealing with a lot in the past week and before that i had a covid scare that hampered the writing process i just wanted you to know that i havent forgotten about this that being said this will be the last one in the cooking series as i see this idea kinda running its course if you want to add or make your own to the cooking universe ive created please feel free the only stipulation that i add is put me at the universe creator on to the kitchen territ was very very excited he was finally going to meet this mysterious mother of chef sexton or danny as he preferred to be called by his friends he and territ had been introduced onboard the second human vessel he had the pleasure of being on the excited alien had been back to his home hive and had requested a special assignment to explore this new phenomenon being a completely new field of knowledge for the hive he was quickly granted the authority to be the first researcher and requests for an apprenticeship in a human kitchens where soon sent out it was on the merchant vessel rolling sunrise that he first met his teacher chef sexton it was a rough first month for the bug scholar as danny had an immediate distrust of him and his strangeness territ was also led to believe he resented his position as teacher something he complained about to his superior on numerous occasions territ and his companion jart did their best to stay out of the cooks way being that their lower body was on average longer than an adult human it was territ s intention to find a spot to observe the crew while not being in the way which as it turns out was next to impossible so he occupied a place between obstacle and stepping stool as his armoured legs where more than capable of holding up a human as they stepped on him to get around jart had to be sequestered in territ s quarters after an incident involving spilling a large soup pot this had nearly had the poor scholar evicted from the kitchen entirely territ had compromised heavily in order to stay in his position of observation such as he was restricted to observing and recording not asking questions unless asked first as well as leaving during meal times and relegated to dish duty after these times to make up for the spilled soup it was a hard month for the bug where he was taught little and observed plenty however through his observations he was able to learn some of the basics of cooking like proper kitchen attire the white button down shirts and black pants although he wore no pants do to the nature of his legs he wore black cloth over his carapace something he had eagerly commissioned for one of his species there was also mixing separating seasoning and taste testing seemed to be crucial in making a delicious dish the meat was a perplexing subject to him simply by the confusion of using animal muscle to add to a meal or using it as the base of a meal entirely such as seasoning steaks before cooking them an understanding that they cook after being removed from the meat every night he would go over his knowledge and organize it before taking his jart out to roam the halls of the merchant ship for some much needed socialization the crew outside of the kitchen liked his walks down the passageways and would often stop to pet or say hello before returning to their tasks after a month of this routine observing cleaning and basically being a living breathing obelisk in the kitchen danny had talked to him as a being instead of as a nuisance he brought over a cutting board and a knife and looked at him okay imma teach you how to cut lettuce for the salads that had been his first proper introduction to cooking over the next few weeks they would leave vegetables with territ to chop at the part of the kitchen he was standing at still not allowed to leave his position he was at least being given tasks he was learning how to cook they taught him how to julian chop peel proper knife handling techniques sharpening understanding a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one making sure the few times he would cut himself would be as shallow as possible not a exactly a happy lesson his confidence with a blade grew in the next few weeks and that led to more and more things taught until the kitchen staff no longer saw him as a obstruction although he still was but as a chef in training learning like they had my grandmas a great cook danny would often say she does the best pigs in a blanket cookies and her deviled eggs he put his fingers to his lips and made sound territ learned was akin to kissy sounds although being protein he could not see the appeal though was still fascinated by the process of making these deviled eggs i would very much like to meet this grandmother of yours is she a leader of your family he gave a chuckle at that remark while he seasoned a chicken before putting it in the oven and setting a timer no um grand in this term means elder so shes the mother of my mother so grand mother it was similar to territ s own generational gap the territ he most looked up to was territ of the second generation she is a most skilled cook oh yeah he stated picking up some carrots and slicing them into carrot sticks she taught me everything i know i spent hours at her side learning the ins and outs of feeding the family he was awed to him the most accomplished cook he knew was the head chef whom didnt seem to have a name other than the title she was given as when she told you to do something the appropriate and only response was yes chef and nothing else yet to chef danny there was someone whom was even more skilled i would very much like to meet your grand mother this seemed to catch him off guard as he paused in his work a great deal later followed by some communications back to his home planet and requests territ had sent to the human government for a travelers passport he was ready to go down to the colony planet of jargon danny was nervous he was returning home on shore leave while the ship went through its scheduled maintenance but he was also bringing an alien that humanity had been hearing about but no ones really seen their treaties and paperwork between politicians was still on going he knew territ and his little balatain that his hive called jart where alright for aliens respectful polite and very aware that they where the first of his species most humans would meet for now however he was bringing this big sentient bug into a very personal setting with his friends and family people who didnt have to worry about that kind of thing and werent concerned with active professional just being polite what had surprised him the most was how much his grandma wasnt against him bringing territ he couldnt stand to say seventyeight every time down to meet and learn from her she seemed excited to teach this bug a thing or two about human cooking for herself which was a large part of what was making him nervous jargon his homeworld is one of the later colony worlds established in the human sector only about two hundred years old and only sporting half a million settlers it was considered small by comparison to some of the big agricultural worlds like cornucopia or bob though being this close to the new borders with the new lifeforms that was sure to change once trade finally got rolling his home sat on the smaller of the five continents in the northern part of the world similar to canada hes told but hed never actually been to earth being raised by women his whole life as his dad was out of the picture he was very close with his grandma as she often took care of him while his mother was working so hed spent hours cooking and baking with grandma tending the garden and listening to her talk about her life these days eighty was the new sixty and she was still spry and active in the community as well as the church so home still felt like home even with his moms new boyfriend living with them the house still smelled of freshly baked bread and the old piano sat against one wall while a mobile hung from the ceiling with little hand carved toys he and his friends had made as kids thunk he turned to look back at territ whose legs had bumped against the door frame dude be careful he went to examine the door and breathed relief when he saw there was no damage this house is super old man he ushered his friend through the door and closed it where was everyone mom gram he noticed jart looking around anxiously seeing everything and eager to go exploring whatever invisible leash territ kept him on holding him at bay stay here im gonna go look for em he walked through the house checking the living room kitchen and finally noticing them out back on the patio sipping lemonade and talking it was springtime afterall and a cool degrees sweety his mom got up and gave him a hug he was always away for long stretches of time how are you she squeezed him tight he held her closely for a moment just enjoying her presence they when he was released his grandma gave him an even happier hug you little gremlin nearly lifting him off his feet she then stopped and looked over his shoulders where is it he he quickly corrected her i wanted to make sure you hadnt gone out or something ill get him going back and guiding him through the house he introduced his alien friend to his mom and grandma territ this is my mom nyla and my grandma amirah mom gram this is the cooking scholar i told you about oh whose this said gram seemingly ignoring the introduction in favour of the furry little friend it came over full of excited energy and ran its antenna over the hand she presented him gram thats jart his companion kind of like a dog and cleaner feeling the need to educate his friends family actually they clean our carapace and help clean our wounds we are dependent on them as they are us traditionally for protection although in more recent centuries it is more for food and shelter his mom looked territ in the eye you use numbers to name yourself doing those complex hand movements this one an arch followed by another one to indicate humour ve are not given names as other species do ve simply use numbers to help separate ourselves within the hive i am of the seventh generation and the eighth to reach maturity there are others within my generation with three digit numbers as well she looked blankly at him trying to wrap her head around the concept when danny stepped in and said since hes the only one here i just call him territ thankful for a solid way to address him she put out her hand territ nice to meet you oh do you her words trailed off as the alien well versed in human customs shook her hand of course you do it took some time for his family to get accustomed to their guest as they talked on the patio then a new round of introductions when his moms boyfriend came in with the other family friends and family that had made it out here for this get together territ was very well mannered making sure he did not move much so he didnt trip anyone with his long carapace backside and making small talk about his life as he had lived eighty years by human standards and spent much of that time as a scholar as humans understood it studying space travel and celestial bodies it had surprised many when they had found he had switched his studies over to the culinary arts there is no equivalent among my species ve view eating as a somewhat unimportant affair ve process plant matter and make convenient meal packets one can eat on the move my experience aboard captain falks ship showed ve there was a whole new set of the knowledge we as a species needed to learn his grandma let the family and group chat up the alien for awhile before finally stealing him to go and prepare supper she handed him an apron and showed him how to put it on before washing her hands and getting started cooking on the ship was very different than cooking in a home as id come to learn there was much more for one or even two people to do and it seemed there was much more pride taken in the work although this being only the second cook i was acquainted with it wasnt something i could say for sure now ive heard your kind are vegetarians i gave a nod expecting her to be courteous like the others well well be cooking some lasagna anyway we like meat an your going to learn how to cook some this was no a pleasing thing to hear and my rolling stomach did not agree with it either ve will do our best she gave me a solid look a single nod of her head good and began going through her cupboards we started with the sauce which had the meat in it along with bell peppers tomato sauce tomato paste and crushed tomatoes the onion i had found early in my time in the kitchen to be my least favourite vegetable to chop here was no different as we added it to the sauce she then had me set up water to boil while she began pulling out ingredients for the spicy sandwich loaf with some dough she had made earlier today i spread it out on a backing sheet lined with aluminum foil and made a rectangle she easily managed three burners with the third a skillet with mushrooms and green pepper then came the meat jart was clicking frantically and waving its antenna smelling hoping for an errant piece to leave my grasp one piece may of made its way downward layering ham salami cheese and pepperoni down the centre of the dough topping them with the mushrooms and peppers fold the sides of the dough over filling lapping the edges turning the seam down pinching the ends together and tucking under the seal all of this following her instructions and supervision while she made the lasagna the room was starting to smell heavily of meat both dishes placed in the oven she pulled out a container covered in plastic and handed it to me here this is for you she quickly washed out the skillet shed been using and put it back on the stove quinoa cakes vegetarian and easy enough to make ive already made them into patties here you start on these while i get the mashed potatoes having seen burger been cooked in the kitchen i mimicked the motions id seen and set the burner to as you never cook anything on high ive been told amirah took out a large baking dish from the fridge and quickly opened up the oven and put it over top of of the main dishes on a higher rack you have prepared a lot of this beforehand without looking me in the eye her focus on the food inside the oven you have to prepare beforehand or else all your doing is cooking when everyones socializing i made the arches once more with my hand we seem to be cooking while others are socializing stopping her frantic work she l pulled up her apron and wiped her hands her face going contemplative as she looked out to the patio where everyone was congregating cooking is much more than just feeding people its a place where people gather an ice breaker for tense moments it makes people happy and it helps connect me to others im giving them something to enjoy that ive put so much work into she gave me the first smile in the kitchen thats why i cook it was one of the moretrue explanations id gotten for cooking then it was back to work we had twelve bellies to fill afterall when we emerged from the kitchen to lay out the food on the table i marveled at the sight laid before us this was so much more than just a lineup of foods beings served to sailors or orders given to the traders this was a meal given to loved ones like a grouping of the hive to share stories or experiences in the casserole dish sat the lasagna the spicey meat loaf toad in the hole baking powder biscuits pickles in a special clear dish crispy potatoes surrounding a roast a greek and a caesar salad steamed vegetables mashed potatoes and finally my quinoa cakes when all sat down myself on a pair of stools and jart happily digging into his sandwich meat and fruit there where wine glasses filled and a toast made to my presence nyla stood up with her glass in hand to our guest territ to my son back from nine months in space to new friends and old and family there where raised glasses all around and then we each took a sip before the portioning of the food it was all quite efficient they started with the food right in front of them taking a portion and then passing it down the table with pieces of clothe underneath them hotpads even if the one handed to didnt wish to have the dish they passed it along anyway all of this done in a clockwise circle around the non circular table i found myself feeling quite welcome in the group even though we had only met merely hours ago we all ate with ravenous appetites many compliments going towards myself and amirah and myself on our cooking i was getting praise it was hard not to feel pride in my accomplishments when this was the first time i had made something so complex there was some talk while all where eating mostly enjoying the meal i noted a few people talked while others ate or a few would talk amongst themselves the others taking no offense at their inclusiveness myself was among the listeners as i learned of many anecdotes and stories of danny that i was unaware of him in something called a dress when he was but a hatchling made others laugh while danny turned a shade of red it was when everyone was finished and some where patting full bellies and sitting contently that i realized the power of a well cooked meal what we had turned into a rather mundane exercise of energizing ourselves humans had made it into a ritual of their own it was something to stop for and take time to enjoy to share with others talk bond over cooking wasnt simply properly preparing and combining ingredients to make a nutritious meal it was so much more i will enjoy this study more than i ever have well thats the last one ill be writing in this series hope you enjoyed the grandma teaching territ how to cook i wanted to go with an italian grandma but i have no real experience with italy as a culture and i didnt want to copy what i see off of videos online so i just went with what i

k4woex,A Probably Bad Review of the This Month/Datamined Characters,okay so there are a lot of theories flying around about this almost next years going to go and i kind of wanted to put them together into a post hopefully i kinda got all of them even if this is literally the day after the notification released where i can attempt to describe how dragalia lost is going to go here we go also a little warning i can prove almost none of this a lot of this is speculation first the this month first it starts off about this event which we all got normal stuff and then mana spirals for the adventurers serena and yuya will be added at pm dec do i need to say something here about that however im happy for the people who actually like to use them and are happy a dragonyulethemed onslaught event will be held in middecember alongside a summon showcase featuring new dragonyule versions of one male and one female adventurer dragonyule versions of adventurers from last year and earlier will return in a subsequent summon showcase again super straightforward maybe save up wyrmite if you want to these people are going to be limited skipping dash of disaster because thats also as forward chapter of the main campaign will be added in middecember the first destination our heroes set out for in the land of north grastaea is a place called grams many characters will debut in this chapter so get ready to remember some new names and faces now this is where it gets a little interesting grams north grastaea places ruled by the chruch etc etc many characters will debut this chapter starting with the old man himself gatov you know who he is but also with new characters comes new terms and new concepts the time attack challenges event will be held in late december players will have a wider variety of quest difficulties to tackle this year when compared to the last and the rankings themselves will only apply to a certain selection of highdifficulty quests rewards will be adjusted to account for these changes still normal stuff nothing to explainexcept for the eligible quests that are a pushover to most of us io and void battles i kind of wanted to think about why theyre giving us this because some elite is just going to knock out competition getting as their time just confusing to me someone can tell me otherwise in comments imma just keep going ・a yearend update for the alberian battle royale is in the works we plan to add new map mechanics and the ability to use skins of the adventurers in your roster and weapons in your inventory please note that skins for some but not all adventurers can be unlocked with certain items or traded for in the treasure trade these adjustments will help keep the mode fresh so be sure to check it out if you havent played in a while now this is kinda neat itll probably be just like mana spirals in terms of availability just basically whoever they can let play also new fortnite map mechanics i really dont want to know we are working hard on highdifficulty quests to succeed the agito uprising and hope to release more information sometime next year as a sneakpeek have a look at the design of one of the bosses you can expect to battle xb this this one thing we were waiting for okadasan we know legend is going to come out for all of the other agitos whats next a new wave of bosses now theres a lot of weird stuff about this one though people can accurately guess something theyre the archangels now now i get it weird horns black stones no halo hinomotanlook i know however we are entering the deeper grounds of the chruch the cross is actually something were going to step on and also if you look at ramiels other form the one on the left side of his art it kind of looks the same now if our new bosses are the archangels this is most likely gabriel the five other than ramiel is gabriel sandalphon raphael michael and metatron i grabbed these names from the persona wiki even if they arent confirmed they would most certainly be somewhat close i know just looking at her she doesnt look super motherly shes probably corrupted by something and what happens to pinon and the other apostles we just gotta wait on that and look were well enough into the story by now to say that if they arent the archangels then theyre at least related to the chruch the next legenddifficulty quest for the agito uprising will be made available in late january of we will provide further information including which boss will be featured in an upcoming notification posted ingame and on the official social media channels this guys obviously kai yan so theres nothing to say here except get ready though there will not be a yearend episode of dragalia digest this year please rest assured that the traditional endofyear events will be arriving in full force including a lucky letters raffle and login bonus look forward to further details soonin addition this year will close out with a hinomotoanthemed event just as previous ones did however unlike the events of the past two years this one will have a slightly different atmosphere and will shine a light on those who would oppose the twelve wyrmclans rather than work with themfinally we plan to start the new year off right with an announcement in early january so i hope youll find time for some dragalia lost fun throughout this holiday season normal stuff youd expect but the digest thats honestly cool with me though its actually kind of a little unassuring i think the yearend episode is something the unveils the next collab and couldve potentially introduced the archangels but mostly the collab and ill explain now the datamined potential characters weve been seeing posts of xb so as far as im hearing because i dont know anything cygames outside of the little gbfknights of glory dragalia lost contains every character from cagliostro orchis is cygames franchise which is cool though personas a thing i can talk about very well so yeah i guess persona is a thing in dragalia lost so definitely save up for that even if it isnt confirmed i know i seem super lax about it more or less just for the reason that fmitsuba cost me a little extra the unknown section kind of seems to be original dl charactersnpcs thatll be making their appearance in this threemonth span anyway thats all i got please do tell me if ive got

jh3igs,always mop the chalk circles.,there really isn’t much of a point in me posting this a call into an echoless void i suppose one that cannot garnish a response i after a little over hours now have drunk the last energy drink swallowed the last adderall when the crash comes to collect i won’t be able to fill the bucket and mop the walls barely managed to finish the ceiling this past time before my legs failed me so here i am writing it out how i fucking died it started about a month ago when i was promoted i got called up from the mailroom at the time i thought i was going to be let go instead i met with msmura head of the rd department at the slaktare chemical corp she told me they had decided to promote from within move me somewhere my degree could get put to work training videos that’s the first thought that crossed my mind what else could a film degree be used for at a chemical company msmura went on and on about how i would love the new team she led me into a lab inside were three others adam he was a chemical engineer from some fancy school working on his phd the next was someone i knew imani she was a chemist and my parking neighbor lastly was a tall stout middleaged man drfleisch following introductions they explained that i would record everything they deemed relevant and would later transcribe it msmura went on to hand me a stack of papers a contract which contained both an nda and a noncompete agreement i signed it as soon as i saw the pay increase almost triple my mailroom pay they said i’d even get acknowledged for the project msmura and drfleisch started to leave with my contract before she went through the door she turned and told me i could ask adam and imani what the project was so i did smiles crept onto their faces before saying in unison chalk from this point forward i will be adding in some of the transcriptions it saves time i should’ve started writing days ago anything important as far as i can tell i’ll include most of the first week was spent obtaining new recording gear making an editing bay in a corner of the lab and showing all of them how to turn on microphones drfleisch refused to wear a microphone so i used a camera mounted shotgun mic as well day fleisch “hello i am drali fleisch i am here in our lab to my left are my assistants manning the camera is our new documentarian and this” he picked up a small black box “is fleischslaktare chalk for legal reasons i will not go into how it is made however it is more similar to phosphorus than to calcium carbonate” after showing the chalk to the camera he instructed me to film imani putting the chalk through various tests first it was water then boiling water then oil then boiling oil then several kinds of acid hydrochloric nitric sulfuric and so on imani “as you can see so far the chalk reacts to almost nothing but with the help of adam here we will demonstrate another interesting factor” she handed the chalk piece to adam who subsequently threw it at the wall when he brought it back he held it in front of the camera adam “you can’t break this shit” imani hit adam on the shoulder imani “the chalk cannot be broken we will further show this with various tests eric please edit out adam’s profanity we need to be taken seriously” at that point i didn’t understand i had a few questions during our lunch break what would be the point of chalk that couldn’t break it wouldn’t be able to write and if it was truly unbreakable why make chalk with it they started rambling on about the chalk almost all of it went over my head but i came away with a few things one you can use it to write which led to a followup question about erasure adam informed me that it could be wiped away with water once it was written with and it couldn’t write on wet surfaces two it naturally held the shape of a typical chalk stick when made of course there was some variation but the six pieces made so far average out at about mm in diameter and mm in length they did not know why as they didn’t know how to make it only drfleisch did three i would soon find out that it being unbreakable was the least interesting thing about the chalk the rest of that day and the ones that followed it were spent mostly on tests trying to break it the hydraulic press had no effect neither did the table saw two high powered winches a blowtorch and even a gun for that test msmura brought in a large man from the security team he had brought a large rifle i don’t know much about guns but it shot bullets the length of my phone if i hadn’t been there and only saw the footage i would’ve thought it to be special effects it just didn’t make any sense the chalk weighed almost nothing you know like how chalk is supposed to weigh but whatever tests they ran it wouldn’t break day fleisch “what i am about to demonstrate might quite possibly be the most important discovery in the history of mankind we have already demonstrated the strength of the fschalk but now we will demonstrate it’s true purpose” he turned behind him and strode to a large blackboard that went from floor to ceiling it took everything at that moment for me not to burst out laughing as i followed him with the camera indestructible chalk truly a monumental step forward for mankind i’m sure he knew what i was feeling right now adam and imani probably felt the same way before seeing it fleisch “please observe” he began to draw a large circle on the blackboard as soon as it was complete the inside of the circle turned a different shade of black no it wasn’t just the color the wall inside the circle was gone a hole had replaced it white particles floated around inside the hole the space beyond the circle stretched endlessly fleisch “eric i know you this is your first occasion witnessing this but please do keep the camera steady as you can see when a complete circle is made with the chalk it opens up a hole into what we assume is another dimension as of now this is the beginning of our documentation exploring said dimension we will be running various tests working our way up to entering it ourselves” the recording didn’t pick up the constant hum that came from the void when drfleisch sprayed the wall with water the chalk circle broke just as fast as it had come it vanished i ran up and touched the wall it was solid in such a short time i had gone from the office mailman to a small part of a monumental discovery drfleisch left the room and instructed me to clean the wall and start downloading the day’s footage imani and adam basically tackled me when he left the lab imani “see this is why we didn’t tell you you had to see it you would’ve thought we were yanking your chain” adam “isn’t it so fucking cool” that night i had my first dream of the void i was in the lab by myself the circle was humming papers were scattered around the floor a spilled coffee cup was on one of the tables my camera was on the ground day this was the day we really began testing the void at first it was little things imani threw in a coin we heard it bounce adam tossed a brick we heard it break they concluded there was ground within the void next imani used a meter stick to search for a ceiling she found none adam brought over a small drone it’s battery died without ever finding a surface above the entrance five minutes had passed before the drone crashed into the ground we lost a few more drones none to connection loss just the same situation each time for each direction fleisch “this will conclude day one of testing inside the dimension” following this day they ramped up the technology used for the tests i don’t even know what most of the tools or sensors they used were the only one i could really explain was basically a flashlight except adam built it it hooked up to a generator and was about the size of a minifridge i think we all would’ve been blind if we hadn’t been wearing welding goggles the room was lit up completely but in the void it hadn’t changed at all i dreamt of the void again but this time i left the lab only the emergency lights were on in the hallway i made my way to the breakroom but the door wouldn’t budge day fleisch “this will be our final test before human exploration imani help me with the rats” one by one they set twenty small cages into the void using a robotic arm this wasn’t the first time we had placed living things in the void we started with plants then a rat then a cat and then a monkey but now we were back to rats adam had asked what happens if we left a living creature in the void after breaking the circle fleisch decided that would be the final test before he was going to go in i don’t like rats but i couldn’t help but feel squeamish watching them set those cages down when adam broke the circle silence washed over the room the hum of the void had left us we waited for five minutes it felt much longer then fleisch drew another circle and there they were unharmed as far as i could tell fleisch “alright let’s get them out imani eric adam take these to lab drbrunson is going to run some tests on them see if the dimension had any effect on the rats” tonight’s dream was different i could see myself i was asleep in my car i guess it’s good news that i stopped dreaming of the void day it took a few days but the rats had not been affected when i came into the lab fleisch was in a hazmat suit he was talking to msmura in the corner of the room imani and adam were drinking coffee by their desks i set up the camera and audio equipment and once it was set up fleisch gathered us around fleisch “i started down this path alone when i first discovered the chalk years ago i was not able to make enough of it but then msmura found me she gave me backing to pursue my destiny helping along the way expanding the team and resources we had access to you are a part of history now but the next length of the path i must go alone at first i promise you i will share this experience as soon as i can with all of you then we will share it with the world” imani “thank you drfleisch we can’t wait” adam “kickass i can’t wait to take a selfie in there imma get so many likes on the gram” mura “well i think i speak for more than myself when i say this but we are all very proud of you jonas that includes everyone from the board especially” as far as speeches go it’s better than anything i would have been able to come up with i don’t really want to go into the void i’m glad we are nearing the end of the project can’t be much more to film after he goes in there drfleisch gave a sturdy hug to msmura then imani adam and i got handshakes and pats on the back it was time imani had doublechecked everything he had enough oxygen to last a few hours the suit was airtight and a small camera was mounted on his shoulder he took a sip of water before setting down his glass and having adam seal his helmet we all watched as drfleisch climbed through the circle the last part of him on our side was his right hand he was gripping the side of the circle when it happened i was checking audio levels and missed it but the humming stopped imani screamed msmura rushed towards the wall and adam yelled fuck on the ground was about half of drfleischs gloved hand severed at the palm i couldn’t breathe i watched as imani tried to draw another circle but the chalk broke the very same piece of chalk that we couldn’t break no matter what we tried snapped in her hands imani “where are the other pieces adam fucking hell he’s in there and he’s hurt how the fuck did the circle close there was no water where are the other pieces” adam “i don’t know i don’t know he always brings them out msmura do you have any ide” we could hear msmura screaming from down the hall she must’ve slipped out as soon as the chalk broke we found her in drfleisch’s office the safe below his desk was empty the black box which he kept his chalk was not there others had come from neighboring labs to find out what was going on drbrunson the biologist was the first to ask what was going on it took a while for everything to settle down as far as msmura could tell drfleisch either hid the chalk somewhere else or took it inside with him it was his life’s work after all i was told to go on home everyone else was going to try and make new chalk from the notes found in drfleisch’s safe after packing up all my gear i stumbled out to the parking lot and sat in my car i couldn’t drive i couldn’t just leave when no one else was so i waited and waited i ended up falling asleep when i woke it was am i looked to my left imani’s car was still there i drove to the nearest starbucks and got a round of coffee for everyone the lights in the hallways were off but i figured no one had bothered to turn them on they had more important things to do only the emergency lights provided faint visibility as i got closer to the lab i could hear the familiar hum of the void this was the first time i felt happy to hear that fucking sound i swung the door open expecting to see everyone cheering with an injured doctor being bandaged up the lab was empty the void was open so they must’ve gotten him out taken him to a hospital and that was where everyone was i missed it by sleeping in my car i checked my phone no messages i was going to set down the coffees when out of the corner of my eye i noticed something my camera was out on the ground facing the void the coffees landed on my shoes the feeling i normally had when hearing the hum returned i picked up my camera and pressed the library button instead of the hours of footage from today there were about twenty short videos adam and drbrunson were talking in the break room you couldn’t hear them whoever was filming it wasn’t in the room the only sound was their heavy slow breath instead they pointed the camera at them through the plexiglass window in the door it looked like adam was showing drbrunson some files while they drank coffee the security guard the one who brought in the rifle with msmura was sitting at a desk watching monitors he was reading on a kindle occasionally glancing up to look at the monitors i saw myself on one of the monitors asleep in my car the guard’s radio went off and the cameraman moved behind a file cabinet msmura was on the floor in a bathroom stall i recognized her boots she was sobbing she kept saying she was sorry the cameraman moved out of the bathroom he must’ve been holding his breath because it started up again as they moved down the hall they hid around a corner before zooming in on the bathroom exit msmura then came out she looked around she said hello she must’ve realized someone had been watching her i headed toward the door i needed to leave scanning the hallway from the door i saw a man walking backward around a corner as he got closer i could see he was dragging someone i hid under imani’s desk hers was the closest to the door the door was opened awkwardly the room filled with the rhythmic heavy breath from the videos the way the hum and the breathing meshed made me want to vomit as the man passed my hiding place i recognized the person being dragged it was adam i couldn’t tell if he was alive the man dragged him over to the circle before lifting and placing him inside the void the faint glow from the void offered me a look at the man drfleisch in the short time he was there he had changed the once stout man was a walking skeleton his hazmat suit was gone most of his skin looked like tar it festered and bubbled the lost half of his hand had been replaced his new fingers looked to be made out of chalk after he left the room i waited for a few minutes before leaving as well when i made it back to the parking garage i saw imani she must’ve heard me when she spun around her face went from terror to relief she tried to explain the best she could but she just ended up losing her words i told her about the videos and what i saw we went our separate ways she was going to the police i decided to give her the sd card it wasn’t much but it was some sort of evidence that could help i just wanted to go home i think that’s where i fucked up i should’ve gone with imani to the police when i returned to my apartment all i wanted to do was sleep an hour or two past i was awoken by the all to familiar noise of someone drawing with chalk when i turned on my bedside lamp i almost couldn’t believe it a chalk circle was forming on my wall i splashed it with water that familiar noise started again but behind me this time i splashed that one too i ran for the door the hum started outside he was banging on the door turning the knob eventually he stopped but then he started drawing another circle on the ceiling i figured out my routine pretty quickly i mopped the floors the ceiling the walls every hour on the hour it’s been four days since i came home haven’t slept like i said hours ago when i started writing this my body is tired i can’t do this anymore i hope imani made it maybe when he shows up i can bargain with him give him my hard drive with all the transcripts maybe he’ll leave me alone i’m a nobody i worked in the mailroom at least you guys will know i existed i guess i will update this if i wake up but for now i think i’m going to sleep,really much point posting call echoless void suppose one garnish response little hours drunk last energy drink swallowed last adderall crash comes collect able fill bucket mop walls barely managed finish ceiling past time legs failed writing fucking died started month ago promoted got called mailroom time thought going let go instead met msmura head rd department slaktare chemical corp told decided promote within move somewhere degree could get put work training videos first thought crossed mind else could film degree used chemical company msmura went would love new team led lab inside three others adam chemical engineer fancy school working phd next someone knew imani chemist parking neighbor lastly tall stout middleaged man drfleisch following introductions explained would record everything deemed relevant would later transcribe msmura went hand stack papers contract contained nda noncompete agreement signed soon saw pay increase almost triple mailroom pay said even get acknowledged project msmura drfleisch started leave contract went door turned told could ask adam imani project smiles crept onto faces saying unison chalk point forward adding transcriptions saves time started writing days ago anything important far tell include first week spent obtaining new recording gear making editing bay corner lab showing turn microphones drfleisch refused wear microphone used camera mounted shotgun mic well day fleisch hello drali fleisch lab left assistants manning camera new documentarian picked small black box fleischslaktare chalk legal reasons go made however similar phosphorus calcium carbonate showing chalk camera instructed film imani putting chalk various tests first water boiling water oil boiling oil several kinds acid hydrochloric nitric sulfuric imani see far chalk reacts almost nothing help adam demonstrate another interesting factor handed chalk piece adam subsequently threw wall brought back held front camera adam break shit imani hit adam shoulder imani chalk broken show various tests eric please edit adam profanity need taken seriously point understand questions lunch break would point chalk break able write truly unbreakable make chalk started rambling chalk almost went head came away things one use write led followup question erasure adam informed could wiped away water written write wet surfaces two naturally held shape typical chalk stick made course variation six pieces made far average mm diameter mm length know know make drfleisch three would soon find unbreakable least interesting thing chalk rest day ones followed spent mostly tests trying break hydraulic press effect neither table saw two high powered winches blowtorch even gun test msmura brought large man security team brought large rifle know much guns shot bullets length phone saw footage would thought special effects make sense chalk weighed almost nothing know like chalk supposed weigh whatever tests ran break day fleisch demonstrate might quite possibly important discovery history mankind already demonstrated strength fschalk demonstrate true purpose turned behind strode large blackboard went floor ceiling took everything moment burst laughing followed camera indestructible chalk truly monumental step forward mankind sure knew feeling right adam imani probably felt way seeing fleisch please observe began draw large circle blackboard soon complete inside circle turned different shade black color wall inside circle gone hole replaced white particles floated around inside hole space beyond circle stretched endlessly fleisch eric know first occasion witnessing please keep camera steady see

ii1udn,"Traded 5 grams of weed for this , pretty sure imma have to cut my arm off .",,
io0lkk,"""Yooo My Slime"": How I Got Caught 😱 By an Undie 🐽 For Tryna Sell Piff 🍃🍃",undie 🐽 sj i was at a plaza in my area tryna sell loud cuz i had no job and wanted money i bought a half ounce of loud for i saw some friends and made a sale of a gram cuz its a high traffic area the next day i hit up the plaza again but none of my friends were there so i could sell to them i was there for a long time and i was desperate to make money so desperate that if i found a dollar of the ground i would be super happy i walked around asking random ppl if they need weed but they dont want then i see a somali guy with a leather jacket leaning on a concrete column i walk up to him and ask if he needs weed he responds by saying how much you selling ⚠️⚠️ this is a big red flag⚠️⚠️ no one who wants weed asks how much are you selling they just request for the amount they want i didnt have much street smarts but i wasnt clueless either i did have some street smarts so instead of saying a dumb statement like i have a half ounce of weed i just said i got what you need you need a certain amount ill get you then he says are you selling dime bags ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ this is a super top warning sign no one calls it a fucking dyme bahg thats some s school psa type of language in my city toronto people call a gram a deego i was desperate for money and naive about the fact that yes police will arrest you for selling weed they are authoritarians so i continued on i replied back to the somali man i got what you need instead of saying yes i have weed because that is just double incriminating when talking its always good to be vague instead of specific i then said you can smell it and if you like it you can buy if you dont like it you dont have to buy thats how capitalism works then he laughed and said 🤣🤣🤣 thats funny and i could tell it was a genuine laugh i then took out some loud and held my hand to him so he could smell it but he wasnt smelling it so i said huh its right here smell it he replied dont you see this badge and brought my attention to his left hand which had a police badge😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 his bad was so old the shield emblem was sideways this meant he had bare experience as a jake i said woah woah woah woah man im sorry after i said that he put his shoe on my shoe and took physical control of me so i cant run away then hes like imma have to call the squad car and theyll pick you up and send u to a location and youll have the choice of telling us where u got your supply from if u give us good info its all charges dropped i didnt wanna snitch though 💯💯💯 i say cant you just let me go its my st time then he said you know how many times ive heard ppl like you say that do you think i was born yesterday then im like i actually am telling the truth tho if you give me a criminal record how am i supposed to get a job somali undie replied back you shoulda thought about that before you sold weed then i attempted to say but in society rehabilitation should be the focus so ppl can contribute to society but i fumbled my words and said but in society society is thing man its thing man society then he asked for my phone number and i didnt wanna give that so i was stalling after some time of stalling the cop said if you dont give me your number i will rub your face in the concrete then i had my hands up and said but im being non violent why would u do

fumdpu,"Imma try and edit different things into the background of pics for my gram and see if any of my friends notice, any suggestions?",,
fpffei,"My life isn’t perfect ( money, looks, fame, doesn’t matter )",let’s start by i’m turning tomorrow march th and just fitting out life almost wanted to end it a few times if i was on meds i probably would of done something but i don’t i hate these thoughts if you can understand or relate please reply or even take a minutes or how ever long it takes to realize your not the only one and i’m with you and i’m falling but hopefully fall into place my mom wanted to move and i never really wanted to move last year jan th we stayed in a hotel for a few months and i went to school and started to get into drugs smoking a lot of pot cause my parents grew there own for years and would go out and buy be liquor if i needed it i also started vaping first week of being in the new town i was asked to smoke with some people and i’m still friends with them i made lots of friends then we moved into a rental beside the school just a shack beds baths and no privacy i went to my house in my other town for my th birthday and it was so fun cause i was with my old friends and we went to the movies and i still smoked then but they didn’t smoke so i just had a puff or two out of a dab pen and went to my gym and was fooling and blasting music and having so much laughs haven’t been that happy since i left when i had to go back i begged to not go back but they finally pulled me to go back finally a couple months past i still went to school then summer break started and went back up i hung out with a few other friends one of them never smoked weed so i told him let have the alcohol first we went to the school to have a quick puff one of them have never smoked before like i said also wanted him to be comfortable he hit my davinchi and he didn’t feel it he said cause he was also feeling a drunk buzz but he took another and couldn’t stop coughing my other friend and i was laughing and he also was we all smoked then we were backing back and the nonsmoker said he felt like he was in a game and running while i was laughing we walked to mcdonalds and got food enough of that story i’m all over the place let me get to the serious part so i had to go back to my “new town” my friends asked me to do shrooms for the first time blue vein strain took a gram each went to denny’s and once we got there was about minute walk we sat down and didn’t feel like eating they all felt the effects and i didn’t still i went outside long story short we walked back to his place and i said imma walk home by myself this is in town a lot of druggies live here i was walking home and i was on my phone and realized i was walking in the middle of the road good thing the town is dead at night besides the bums hanging at the schools got home to my rental and went to the bathrooms and laughed so hard and realized how skinny i was couldn’t sleep watched spongebob fav show felt tired for the rest of the next day and down and anxious i also took a break from smoking weed if i do remember for about a week unless i went to parties and then stoped but i stoped smoking august st cause when i took my tolerance break to get high again i took a bowl like i normally would and was so high now this wasn’t my weed some black kids not being racist or point fingers and i coughed so much and tasted butane not good weed but still got you high i was ringing and tingling all over my body and mostly face and ears then the cops pulled up to the school and i just told my friends that i knew was there that i wanted to go home cause i knew i wasn’t normal got home open the door and it creeped and felt like i was in a movie or a puppet went to the kitchen and got milk to try and throw up i told my mom i was high and was going to throw up and i did and i guess i passed out on her bed with my eyes and mouth hide open and was freezing cold and white i didn’t remember anything once i woke up for a few seconds or who my mom was i told her to take me to the hospital cause she knew i smoked with those guys and i didn’t till my memory came back we got there and thought i was overdosing my pupils where huge like i was on shrooms i kept blacking in and out and scared and didn’t know were i was while i was in the hospital and screamed for help doctor said it was just weed i didn’t believe it couldn’t sleep for a few days only during day and was very depressed and anxious and got therapy and saw a psychiatrist and got a paediatrician for a doctor to prescribe me meds so i guess it was a panic attack and been on prozac for a few months and a stimulant cause i may got adhd cause i got a lot of the symptoms the psychiatrist doesn’t know oh also since that panic attack i have been home schooled and i know i’m smart but don’t do anything i did some math and got a anyways i’m

ejzur0,[Curiosité Gram.] La grammaticalisation en français : exemples et remarques,on désigne par le terme de grammaticalisation un phénomène observé dans la plupart des langues naturelles et qui renvoie pour parler rapidement au processus selon lequel un mot plein dit encore lexical se transforme avec le temps en motoutil ou en structure grammaticale parfaitement figée par le biais dune désémantisation cestàdire une perte ou une transformation de son sens premier en français par exemple lancienne expression ce pendant pendant cela a été réanalysée en un seul mot outil marquant dans la langue moderne lopposition ou la concession cependant et pendant luimême est une grammaticalisation du participe présent du verbe pendre au sens dattendre cest là un processus qui a été observé dans de très nombreuses langues cf anglais will qui passe de lexpression de la volonté à celle du futur certains verbes composés en japonais voir ce lien wikipedia pour quelques exemples choisis néanmoins malgré son omniprésence dans les langues naturelles et les très très nombreuses études à son propos les premières intuitions remontant au début du dixneuvième siècle les premières études modernes datant du début du vingtième siècle nous sommes loin den avoir compris tous les mécanismes il reste effectivement plusieurs grandes questions dont i la directionnalité du phénomène généralement on tend à présenter le modèle global comme étant du type mot lexical mot grammatical clitique affixeflexion mais il est des exemples étranges de dégrammaticalisation au cours de lhistoire des langues ce qui remet en question le mouvement unidirectionnel général ii les contextes de grammaticalisation quels sont les facteurs tant endogènes quexogènes qui invitent les locuteurices à transformer un mot lexical en outil grammatical sontils toujours constants iii la chronologie du changement la grammaticalisation estil un phénomène lent ou rapide les sources semblent contradictoires et iv les conséquences systémiques de la grammaticalisation sur lensemble du système linguistique sagitil de remplir une case vide dans le système et donc de résoudre un problème ponctuel ou bien cela engagetil une reconfiguration générale au niveau morphosyntaxique on sen doute ces questions qui agitent la communauté scientifique depuis des siècles ne seront pas résolues ici je me contenterai de présenter quelques cas fameux de grammaticalisation dans lhistoire de la langue française qui me serviront à illustrer les mécanismes fondamentaux du processus du moins tels quon les considère aujourdhui xb i futur et conditionnel synthétique formes verbales en r les langues romanes dont le français ont refondu le système temporel latin de différentes façons lune des inventions de la romania fut linstauration des formes en r pour construire le futur et le conditionnel français nous ferons espagnol haremos italien faremo etc alors que le latin employait le morphème ba ou e amabo faciemus cette réfection paradigmatique sest cependant opérée grâce à une opération de grammaticalisation par lentremise dune périphrase verbale effectivement en prenant lexemple du français jaimerai le protofrançais nemployait pas la forme synthétique latine qui sest assez tôt confondue pour des raisons phonétiques notamment avec le présent il a donc fallu trouver une forme de substitution qui ne provoquait pas dambiguïtés il a été choisi pour ce faire le verbe avoir qui avait encore un sens proche de lobligation ou du devoir on trouvait ainsi en latin populaire des formes telles amare habeo jai à aimer soit je dois aimer doù jaimerai temps allant ces éléments subirent diverses modifications phonétiques mais également structurelles leur contiguïté régulière invita à les considérer comme faisant partie du même élément syntaxique ou de la même structure et cela conduisit alors à souder le verbe avoir conjugué au présent à linfinitif du verbe cela donna alors en détaillant les étapes de lévolution les exemples a aimer j ai b j aimerai c jaimerai on voit donc le mouvement décrit précédemment conduit de bout en bout un mot lexical au sens plein le verbe avoir devient un mot grammatical il aide à construire le futur puis finalement une marque de tiroir verbal cestàdire un morphème lié il est devenu aujourdhui très opaque pour les locuteurs et locutrices modernes notamment du fait de la réfection de la p et de la p partie pour des raisons phonétiques partie par analogisme avec les terminaisons du présent on peut cependant à peu de frais retrouver lorigine étymologique du futur synthétique français en isolant linfinitif du verbe jaimerai tu aimeras il aimera nous aimeravons vous aimeravez ils aimeront le phénomène sobserve de même avec le conditionnel si ce nest que le verbe avoir est conjugué à limparfait lorigine étymologique est cependant plus obscure dans la mesure où cette foisci toutes les personnes ont perdu la première syllabe av par analogie avec le paradigme du futur qui sest penseton stabilisé plus tôt jaimeravais tu aimeravais il aimeravait nous aimeravions vous aimeraviez ils aimeravaient on notera quà lépoque moderne ce futur et conditionnel synthétique est à nouveau concurrencé par une forme analytique mettant cette foisci à profit le verbe aller je vais aller et il nest pas interdit de croire que dici quelques siècles le même mécanisme se produise à linstar de ce que lon peut observer en anglais contemporain où la forme im gonna love tend à se réduire notamment dans la langue populaire imma love etc or la réduction phonétique est souvent cité comme un des facteurs favorisant la grammaticalisation les linguistes du futur nous le diront sans doute xb ii la négation bitensive ne pasmiegouttepointmais la langue française se distingue des autres langues romanes et dun assez grand nombre de langue du monde par son système négatif dit bitensif effectivement alors que de nombreuses langues du monde y compris les étapes anciennes de la langue française nont quune seule particule négative non not nicht etc le français a redoublé à compter de lancien français tardif sa particule négative ne issue directement du latin non dun second adverbe généralement employé après le verbe en français moderne cet adverbe est généralement pas mais on peut aussi trouver point senti comme une variante soutenue du précédent voire des formes archaïques comme mie goutte ou mais ce dernier étant sans doute le plus rare je naime paspointmiegouttepointmais nous avons des sources assez précises quant au mouvement de lapparition de ces adverbes il sagit historiquement des substantifs correspondants qui notamment après des verbes dont ils redoublaient le sens à la façon des compléments dobjets internes dont nous avions parlé jadis ici mettaient en avant la négation ils étaient interprétés ainsi comme des marques dinsistance a je ne marche pas je ne fais pas même un seul pas b je ne bois goutte je ne bois pas même une seule goutte au fur et à mesure du temps cependant cette tournure étant constamment employée en contexte négatif elle finit par devenir une marque de négation à part entière cela résolut du reste un problème majeur effectivement la chute de laccent de mot au long de la période médiévale et le monosyllabisme de la particule ne la rendait susceptible de disparaître elle était pourtant de la plus haute importance dans la compréhension de lénoncé il fallait donc assurer sa survie et ces candidats furent alors privilégiés on notera quau regard des morphèmes du futur les particules postposées ont évolué en mots grammaticaux mais ne sont pas devenus des clitiques à proprement parler notamment ils peuvent être intensivés par dautres adverbes je ne marche vraiment pas alors que dordinaire seuls des clitiques peuvent santéposer à dautres clitiques voir ici cette grammaticalisation est en revanche fort bien ancrée dans les usages tant et si bien que depuis lépoque classique au moins la particule pas marque la négation dans la langue courante au contraire lemploi du ne négatif seul est considéré comme une variante soutenue la négation bitensive est quant à elle considérée comme la seule normée a je naime pas b je naime c jaime pas quant à savoir pourquoi pas est devenu ladverbe négatif par excellence en lieu et place de ses concurrents plusieurs hypothèses ont été avancées sans que lune à ma connaissance ne se démarque notablement des autres on considère cependant généralement quil y a eu simplement une question de fréquence le redoublement de la négation trouvant davantage à se trouver dans des verbes liés au déplacement il aurait alors créé un patron qui se serait ensuite imposé à tous les contextes par analogisme xb iii les locutions prépositionnelles àen n de dernière famille dexemples les locutions prépositionnelles je me concentrerai ici sur celles du type àen n de telles en face de à côté de à force de au vu de etc une liste peut être trouvée ici ces locutions sont construites identiquement avec un substantif interpolé entre deux prépositions simples de à sa droite et à ou en à sa gauche comme vous le voyez cependant dans la liste donnée cidessus ces locutions sont nombreuses en français tant et si bien quil nest pas aujourdhui à ma connaissance de liste exhaustive de cellesci un test de substitution permet cependant détablir leur rôle prépositionnel et leur identification comme une forme solidaire soudée on ne peut du reste point la segmenter et ce daucune façon a je suis en face de la poste b je suis devant la poste c je suis en face absolue de la poste plus que les exemples précédents il semble que le mouvement de la grammaticalisation soit ici particulièrement transparent tant et si bien que le sens premier du substantif par exemple face ou côté est encore aujourdhui parfaitement transparent nous serions alors dans une sorte détape intermédiaire ou de chemin alternatif à celui présenté plus haut si dans ces locutions ce qui était anciennement un substantif ou le noyau pour reprendre une expression que lon trouve parfois dans la grammaire générative nen a plus les propriétés distributionnelles cf c il ne peut plus être suivi dun adjectif et ne peut être précédé dun déterminant il a cependant gardé une grande partie de son sémantisme initial on notera enfin quau regard des prépositions simples avec lesquelles ces locutions rentrent parfois en concurrence a vs b elles permettent denrichir les possibilités de la langue par exemple en distinguant une personne qui serait sur le même trottoir que le bâtiment de la poste ou bien sur le trottoir den face dune façon similaire à ce que lon observe en français contemporain sur lopposition àsur voir ici xb iv observations diverses et évolutions modernes les exemples précédents et les semblables font privilégier aujourdhui dans certains articles le terme de pragmaticalisation à celui de grammaticalisation ou encore invitent à considérer que la grammaticalisation nest quune souscatégorie dun phénomène linguistique plus large et que lon désignerait sous le terme de pragmaticalisation la différence tient effectivement à ce quautant il est généralement considéré quun mot grammatical na pas de sens en luimême ou plutôt que son interprétation se colore en fonction de son contexte demploi autant un mot lexical tend à avoir une représentation davantage figée dans lesprit du locuteur on peut encore dire quun mot grammatical est plus abstrait quun mot lexical et quil désigne davantage une relation entre les parties du discours et non un objet qui aurait une représentation dans le monde réel cest cependant une propriété endogène au système de langue pour lequel il fait sens dopposer distinctement mot grammatical et mot lexical la notion de pragmaticalisation quant à elle a une portée plus large comme son nom le suggère voir ici pour une définition de la pragmatique elle sintéresse davantage à la façon dont ces structures sont effectivement interprétées sans pour autant considérer une dichotomie franche entre grammaire et lexique cela permet dès lors denvisager les occurrences des locutions prépositionnelles du français du type à côté de qui ont un rôle purement grammatical mais qui pourtant conservent un sémantisme avoisinant si ce nest identique à lélément lexical grâce auquel elles se construisent cela permet ainsi de considérer comme émanant dun même mouvement lemploi de certaines structures et expressions qui bien que jouissant dun certain figement dans lusage ne semblent pas purement grammaticaux tels les marqueurs discursifs qui bien que conservant une partie de leur sens premier se dégagent progressivement de celuici nous serions alors dans une phase de cohabitation entre un sens plein et une interprétation pragmatique de la même façon que lon pouvait trouver en moyen français et dans la langue contemporaine soutenue un cependant concessif cependant il était marié et temporel plus proche de son sens premier cependant la nuit tombait a en même temps elle est mariée en même temps na pas ici un sens temporel mais plutôt un sens oppositif du type néanmoins b javoue le tramway est pratique javoue na pas ici le sens dadmettre mais sinterprète plutôt comme une concession c je vais me faire un café tiens tiens a un emploi que lon pourrait qualifier ici dinteractionnel ou de phatique comme on le voit avec ces précédents exemples ce type de structures est assez répandu dans la langue contemporaine et tant à se diffuser assez rapidement dans la communauté linguistique ils

la plupart des langues naturelles et qui renvoie pour parler rapidement au processus selon lequel un mot plein dit encore lexical se transforme avec le temps en motoutil ou en structure grammaticale parfaitement figée par le biais dune désémantisation cestàdire une perte ou une transformation de son sens premier en français par exemple lancienne expression ce pendant pendant cela été réanalysée en un seul mot outil marquant dans la langue moderne lopposition ou la concession cependant et pendant luimême est une grammaticalisation du participe présent du verbe pendre au sens dattendre cest là un processus qui été observé dans de très nombreuses langues cf anglais qui passe de lexpression de la volonté celle du futur certains verbes composés en japonais voir ce lien wikipedia pour quelques exemples choisis néanmoins malgré son omniprésence dans les langues naturelles et les très très nombreuses études son propos les premières intuitions remontant au début du dixneuvième siècle les premières études modernes datant du début du vingtième siècle nous sommes loin den avoir compris tous les mécanismes il reste effectivement plusieurs grandes questions dont la directionnalité du phénomène généralement tend présenter le modèle global comme étant du type mot lexical mot grammatical clitique affixeflexion mais il est des exemples étranges de dégrammaticalisation au cours de lhistoire des langues ce qui remet en question le mouvement unidirectionnel général ii les contextes de grammaticalisation quels sont les facteurs tant endogènes quexogènes qui invitent les locuteurices transformer un mot lexical en outil grammatical sontils toujours constants iii la chronologie du changement la grammaticalisation estil un phénomène lent ou rapide les sources semblent contradictoires et iv les conséquences systémiques de la grammaticalisation sur lensemble du système linguistique sagitil de remplir une case vide dans le système et donc de résoudre un problème ponctuel ou bien cela engagetil une reconfiguration générale au niveau morphosyntaxique sen doute ces questions qui agitent la communauté scientifique depuis des siècles ne seront pas résolues ici je contenterai de présenter quelques cas fameux de grammaticalisation dans lhistoire de la langue française qui serviront illustrer les mécanismes fondamentaux du processus du moins tels quon les considère aujourdhui xb futur et conditionnel synthétique formes verbales en les langues romanes dont le français ont refondu le système temporel latin de différentes façons lune des inventions de la romania fut linstauration des formes en pour construire le futur et le conditionnel français nous ferons espagnol haremos italien faremo etc alors que le latin employait le morphème ba ou amabo faciemus cette réfection paradigmatique sest cependant opérée grâce une opération de grammaticalisation par lentremise dune périphrase verbale effectivement en prenant lexemple du français jaimerai le protofrançais nemployait pas la forme synthétique latine qui sest assez tôt confondue pour des raisons phonétiques notamment avec le présent il donc fallu trouver une forme de substitution qui ne provoquait pas dambiguïtés il été choisi pour ce faire le verbe avoir qui avait encore un sens proche de lobligation ou du devoir trouvait ainsi en latin populaire des formes telles amare habeo jai aimer soit je dois aimer doù jaimerai temps allant ces éléments subirent diverses modifications phonétiques mais également structurelles leur contiguïté régulière invita les considérer comme faisant partie du même élément syntaxique ou de la même structure et cela conduisit alors souder le verbe avoir conjugué au présent linfinitif du verbe cela donna alors en détaillant les étapes de lévolution les exemples aimer ai aimerai jaimerai voit donc le mouvement décrit précédemment conduit de bout en bout un mot lexical au sens plein le verbe avoir devient un mot grammatical il aide construire le futur puis finalement une marque de tiroir verbal cestàdire un morphème lié il est devenu aujourdhui très opaque pour les locuteurs et locutrices modernes notamment du fait de la réfection de la et de la partie pour des raisons phonétiques partie par analogisme avec les terminaisons du présent peut cependant peu de frais retrouver lorigine étymologique du futur synthétique français en isolant linfinitif du verbe jaimerai tu aimeras il aimera nous aimeravons vous aimeravez ils aimeront le phénomène sobserve de même avec le conditionnel si ce nest que le verbe avoir est conjugué limparfait lorigine étymologique est cependant plus obscure dans la mesure où cette foisci toutes les personnes ont perdu la première syllabe av par analogie avec le paradigme du futur qui sest penseton stabilisé plus tôt jaimeravais tu aimeravais il aimeravait nous aimeravions vous aimeraviez ils aimeravaient notera quà lépoque moderne ce futur et conditionnel synthétique est nouveau concurrencé par une forme analytique mettant cette foisci profit le verbe aller je vais aller et il nest pas interdit de croire que dici quelques siècles le même mécanisme se produise linstar de ce que lon peut observer en anglais contemporain où la forme im gon na love tend se réduire notamment dans la langue populaire imma love etc la réduction phonétique est souvent cité comme un des facteurs favorisant la grammaticalisation les linguistes du futur nous le diront sans doute xb ii la négation bitensive ne pasmiegouttepointmais la langue française se distingue des autres langues romanes et dun assez grand nombre de langue du monde par son système négatif dit bitensif effectivement alors que de nombreuses langues du monde compris les étapes anciennes de la langue française nont quune seule particule négative non nicht etc le français redoublé compter de lancien français tardif sa particule négative ne issue directement du latin non dun second adverbe généralement employé après le verbe en français moderne cet adverbe est généralement pas mais peut aussi trouver point senti comme une variante soutenue du précédent voire des formes archaïques comme mie goutte ou mais ce dernier étant sans doute le plus rare je naime paspointmiegouttepointmais nous avons des sources assez précises quant au mouvement de lapparition de ces adverbes il sagit historiquement des substantifs correspondants qui notamment après des verbes dont ils redoublaient le sens la façon des compléments dobjets internes dont nous avions parlé jadis ici mettaient en avant la négation ils étaient interprétés ainsi comme des marques dinsistance je ne marche pas je ne fais pas même un seul pas je ne bois goutte je ne bois pas même une seule goutte au fur et mesure du temps cependant cette tournure étant constamment employée en contexte négatif elle finit par devenir une marque de négation part entière cela résolut du reste un problème majeur effectivement la chute de laccent de mot au long de la période médiévale et le monosyllabisme de la particule ne la rendait susceptible de disparaître elle était pourtant de la plus haute importance dans la compréhension de lénoncé il fallait donc assurer sa survie et ces candidats furent alors privilégiés notera quau regard des morphèmes du futur les particules postposées ont évolué en mots grammaticaux mais ne sont pas devenus des clitiques proprement parler notamment ils peuvent être intensivés par dautres adverbes je ne marche vraiment pas alors que dordinaire seuls des clitiques peuvent santéposer dautres clitiques voir ici cette grammaticalisation est en revanche fort bien ancrée dans les usages tant et si bien que depuis lépoque classique au moins la particule pas marque la négation dans la langue courante au contraire lemploi du ne négatif seul est considéré comme une variante soutenue la négation bitensive est quant elle considérée comme la seule normée je naime pas je naime jaime pas quant savoir pourquoi pas est devenu ladverbe négatif par excellence en lieu et place de ses concurrents plusieurs hypothèses ont été avancées sans que lune connaissance ne se démarque notablement des autres considère cependant généralement quil eu simplement une question de fréquence le redoublement de la négation trouvant davantage se trouver dans des verbes liés au déplacement il aurait alors créé un patron qui se serait ensuite imposé tous les contextes par analogisme xb iii les locutions prépositionnelles àen de dernière famille dexemples les locutions prépositionnelles je concentrerai ici sur celles du type àen de telles en face de côté de force de au vu de etc une liste peut être trouvée ici ces locutions sont construites identiquement avec un substantif interpolé entre deux prépositions simples de sa droite et ou en sa gauche comme vous le voyez cependant dans la liste donnée cidessus ces locutions sont nombreuses en français tant et si bien quil nest pas aujourdhui connaissance de liste exhaustive de cellesci un test de substitution permet cependant détablir leur rôle prépositionnel et leur identification comme une forme solidaire soudée ne peut du reste point la segmenter et ce daucune façon je suis en face de la poste je suis devant la poste je suis en face absolue de la poste plus que les exemples précédents il semble que le mouvement de la grammaticalisation soit ici particulièrement transparent tant et si bien que le sens premier du substantif par exemple face ou côté est encore aujourdhui parfaitement transparent nous serions alors dans une sorte détape intermédiaire ou de chemin alternatif celui présenté plus haut si dans ces locutions ce qui était anciennement un substantif ou le noyau pour reprendre une expression que lon trouve parfois dans la grammaire générative nen plus les propriétés distributionnelles cf il ne peut plus être suivi dun adjectif et ne peut être précédé dun déterminant il cependant gardé une grande partie de son sémantisme initial notera enfin quau regard des prépositions simples avec lesquelles ces locutions rentrent parfois en concurrence vs elles permettent denrichir les possibilités de la langue par exemple en distinguant une personne qui serait sur le même trottoir que le bâtiment de la poste ou bien sur le trottoir den face dune façon similaire ce que lon observe en français contemporain sur lopposition àsur voir ici xb iv observations diverses et évolutions modernes les exemples précédents et les semblables font privilégier aujourdhui dans certains articles le terme de pragmaticalisation celui de grammaticalisation ou encore invitent considérer que la grammaticalisation nest quune souscatégorie dun phénomène linguistique plus large et que lon désignerait sous le terme de pragmaticalisation la différence tient effectivement ce quautant il est généralement considéré quun mot grammatical na pas de sens en luimême ou plutôt que son interprétation se colore en fonction de son contexte demploi autant un mot lexical tend avoir une représentation davantage figée dans lesprit du locuteur peut encore dire quun mot grammatical est plus abstrait quun mot lexical et quil désigne davantage une relation entre les parties du discours et non un objet qui aurait une représentation dans le monde réel cest cependant une propriété endogène au système de langue pour lequel il fait sens dopposer distinctement mot grammatical et mot lexical la notion de pragmaticalisation quant elle une portée plus large comme son nom le suggère voir ici pour une définition de la pragmatique elle sintéresse davantage la façon dont ces structures sont effectivement interprétées sans pour autant considérer une dichotomie franche entre grammaire et lexique cela permet dès lors denvisager les occurrences des locutions prépositionnelles du français du type côté de qui ont un rôle purement grammatical mais qui pourtant conservent un sémantisme avoisinant si ce nest identique lélément lexical grâce auquel elles se construisent cela permet ainsi de considérer comme émanant dun même mouvement lemploi de certaines structures et expressions qui bien que jouissant dun certain figement dans lusage ne semblent pas purement grammaticaux tels les marqueurs discursifs qui bien que conservant une partie de leur sens premier se dégagent progressivement de celuici nous serions alors dans une phase de cohabitation entre un sens plein et une interprétation pragmatique de la même façon que lon pouvait trouver en moyen français et dans la langue contemporaine soutenue un cependant concessif cependant il était marié et temporel plus proche de son sens premier cependant la nuit tombait en même temps elle est mariée en même temps na pas ici un sens temporel mais plutôt un sens oppositif du type néanmoins javoue le tramway est pratique javoue na pas ici le sens dadmettre mais sinterprète plutôt comme une concession je vais faire un café tiens tiens un emploi que lon pourrait qualifier ici dinteractionnel ou de phatique comme le voit avec ces précédents exemples ce type de structures est assez répandu dans la langue contemporaine et tant se diffuser assez rapidement dans la communauté

eftohb,"Got a little ""rapey"" with a diminutive Asian guy at the gym",bros i had just finished up my last set of front squats supersetted with some walking lunges with some massive weight i had a nutty just plain nutty pump going on and figured i could hike up my singlet i usually lift in one of my old wrestling unis and strike few poses to see if my tree trunks for legs looked as big as they felt it was right about then out of the corner of my eye i spotted this twinkish little moon faced dude he was struggling to power clean the bar and grunting with vigor so i gave him credit for trying i noticed he was drinking from a gallon of milk between sets lol little dude must have been trying to bulk anyways i hit some poses and knew that i looked just as huge as i felt only problem i couldnt see the striations nor the vascularity i was expecting after being on my keto cut for the last weeks grams of protein g of carbs per day i knew what my problem was too much hair well with that i set off to the showers to shave my legs and truly look my best as i grabbed my gallon protein jug i noticed that little house chink drop the bar he had failed to rep max lbs and looked really defeated almost ready to cry with the look of disappointment written across his brow he grabbed his milk and keys on a really hip looking lanyard and headed toward the showers i made to the locker room and began to strip off my soaking singlet i folded it nicely and put it into my hbs gym bag monogrammed of course grabbed my straight razor and headed for the showers my little foreign friend had joined me i noticed him remove his oversized sweatshirt and i had to have a chuckle first i noticed it was from tuck i had to giggle at this guy attending such an unprestigious business school surely he was dinged at hbs lol no aa for you buddy second i had to stifle a laugh as i saw his body he looked like your average year old asian which as you know is laughable skinny pale complete lack of defining male characteristics he had a tuft of hair on his chest that he seemed so proud of must have taken years upon years and who knows how many bottles of rogaine get that patch he wore with such pride he apparently was going to shave after his shower but for some reason had a pink ladies safety razor i think shaving was new to him and he just wanted to be cautious i started my shower routine like usual carefully removing a bandage on my right cheek to clean the area where i pin myself i had been hitting the deca and test hard for at least years straight now no cyycles that shits for pussies i noticed my yellow shower buddy was starting his shower process which seemed mostly to center around scrubbing his asshole with a towel wtf asians while he was going this i noticed him look up at me he was definitely mirin my aesthetics and i thought i noticed a twitch in his what can only be described as clit dick tiny yellow uncut and almost sickly looking it looked like a belly button that could pop back in him at anytime he noticed me looking so i gave the obligatory no homo breh and he looked at me slightly confused then screamed back no homo i was a bit taken aback about his uneccesary rage but he was asian after all i know they sometimes do that i went back to my routine now i had moved on to washing off the incredibly strong pheromones constantly excreting from every pore of my body it had been so strong lately that women would get one whiff of me in the club and before i knew it i would have a pussy juice waterfall on my leg as they would grind away i was finishing up washing when my shower was about to take a turn for the strangegoodhawt rapey i reached for my straight razor ready to cut down the mini forest that was covering my lbs of mature vascular striated as fuck muscle when i noticed ching chong was no longer in the shower thats when i felt a tap on my back and spun around that little zipperhead was standing there his tiny pencil dick tucked between his legs and his pink safety razor in his hand he shyly looked at the ground and muttered something i couldnt quite hear i said speak up little breh and he stammered a few moments before coyly saying i shave you now needless to say i was a bit surprised and usually i would reserve something like this for fellow clean cut alpha studs you know some real bros but i felt bad for the little dude so pathetic laughably weak probably never been laid in his life i felt a nonhomo twinge in my cock and i decided to give him go yeah sure you shave my breh but youre not using that little pussy trimmer on this guy youre gonna use my flat blade at first he looked a bit hesitatnt but realized it was my way or the highway and he accepted the offer my inch pussy pounder was now becoming almost fully engorged and i wasnt trying to hide it little gook looked at that meat stick like it was king arthurs sword and i didnt mind no homo he was about to lather me up when i decided i needed to up the ante hey brah imma make you a deal if you can shave a bro clean with no fuckups ill let you roll with me and some hbs and some booth bros but if you so much as nick me with that blade youre going to have to suck on this bwc breh he looked a little bewilidered but i figured as with most asian students that his understanding of english was pretty shitty however a moment later he gave me a mile wide grin and made a little blow job motion as he nodded his head he understood we were underway things started out smooth he knelt down and began to work the razor over my ridciulously muscular thighs i was at full mast at this point and he was forced to ignore that engorged yogurt spewer lest he slip up it was about minutes in he made his mistake lol it was a small little nick i didnt even feel it i rarely feel pain i looked down and saw a little speck of red and a bowl cut haired chinamen looking up at me he had a devlish little grin and it was then i knew it wasnt an accident well zipperhead time to pay up i want you to suck every last drop of brotein out of my love muscle he grabbed it stroked it and genuinely seemed amazed a man could possess a cock over inches that it could become erect and remain rock hard for more than mere seconds or that it could be stimulated for more than seconds without blowing a manwad he jacked my hog and tried to fit it into his dainty mouth but lol it wasnt happening i tired of his approach and decided i needed to teach bruce lee here what helping a bro was all about with that in mind i rammed my rod as deep as i could into his rice hole he gagged and his eyes watered that look of defeat and complete pwnage i had seen in the gym earlier reappeared he knew that with business school they gym and now cocksucking he was a complete beta failure now that i knew he was helpless i decided i wanted to taste the orient and get me some sweet tojo ass i picked him up off the floor in one fell swoop his frail frame made this easy as pie and made me feel even bigger than my lb usually did i quickly turned him around and bent him over what i saw next i wasnt expecting at all now being an alpha as fuck megabro i had fucked my share of women namely white women i knew what to expect with sewer skunk sluts and their brillo pad rubbed assholes years of ibs can do a lot of damage to the coloring around a girls asshole and white girls were the perfect example of these horrors however i had always heard asian chicks were clean as a whistle well i guess asian men were different rumor at hbs was that they had poor hygiene usually from hours of sitting around megapoasting on law websites pretending to be girls online or playing video games and literally shitting themselves where they sat well my little fucktoy must have been an xoer because his manpussy was a mess for the little amount of body hair he possessed he had quite a prodigious amount around his rear entry not only was it hairy but it was encrusted with shit now i understood his insane scrubbing earlier lol he should have stuck with it not one to be deterred i grabbed my razor and was ready to clean up my ladyboy use pink use pink the little gook whimpered and i realized he was very attached to his ladies safety razor lol i figured since i was going to use his asshole like a sperm bank the least i could do was oblige him to use his sissy razor so with his precious pink in hand in no time flat i had him clean and shaved he wiggled around like a bitch in heat and really seemed to enjoy the feeling ready for my prize i hocked a load of spit onto my cock and begin to grease my pole up i didnt want to loosen him up i wanted to go in almost dry and hard maximize the feeling of that tight little chinkhole i think my little yellow friend started to have second thoughts as my throbbing dink inched closer no too big i am virgin i literally laughed out loud he was asian of course he was a virgin there was no way this guy had ever scored with a chick or a bro again he was asian at this point he tried another plea no i am saving for girlfriend she pillow i wasnt sure what the little twink was talking about at first then i remembered some of my xo bros talking about asians and their pillow girlfriends so weird anyways he seemed to know i wasnt having any of his excuses this bro wanted what this clean cut alpha bro wanted with that said pushed forward into his balloon knot and to my surprise i slipped right in i bet this little perv had been jamming stuff in his shitter for years truly a beta even when alone i was pretty worked up from the entire situation and it only took minutes of strong pumping to make me blast a gooey thicket of ball snot into his quivering shitpipe as he whimpered i pulled out my limpening staff it was covered in faeces and cum and looked like a masterpiece when i popped out of him he let out a cumfart and blasted a little cum and shit onto my rock hard six pack disgusted i made him clean me off with his cat like tongue as we exited the showers i watched this breh as he looked at the mirror wiped away a tear then gave that devlish little grin to himself and flex his pathetic biceps i think he felt like a man lol well i didnt want him getting to full of himself and i had the just the cure i went over to my monogrammed hbs gym bag and pulled out some panties some sewer skunk slut had left at my house i usually carried them around to prove to my bros that white women were disgusting and frequently wore shit stained underwear anyways i called over wang chang and told him to put the panties on without hesitation he did so he seemed very comfortable and was twirling around looking at himself in the mirror blowing kisses and queening it up i heard him whisper who the pretty faggot now you the pretty faggot now i couldnt help but lol i soon noticed the clock and that i was almost late for my models and bottles evening i had planned with my hbs bros we usually went to bars where lawyers and law students hung out just to steal their women and talk about our amazing debt free futures i didnt want to miss that so within a few minutes i was heading out and still preening around in his pretty panties was that moon faced breh that i had dominated waiting for the next alpha bro to come in and use him for what he was a cum receptacle,bros finished last set front squats supersetted walking

1jd71s0,I just want advice on how to feel more human again Ig. I want to be able to experience and make sense of my emotions.,so essentially heres what happened in short i knew this girl for about years and only started dating her on the third i met her in th grade and we became really good friends pretty fast around half way through the year she started home schooling for reasons i didnt really ask since i didnt know her well enough at the time and it was never really brought up after but throughout middle school i developed several addictions ranging from just weed to ketamine but in the summer after th grade i started ketamine and that was also around the same time we actually both acknowledged there was more than just a friendship there my parents never met her because they always were kind of assholes about that type of thing which they had theyre reasons for but for clarity essentially my father had attempted to cut multiple people out of my life beforehand and told me id be nothing more than a homeless heroin addict on multiple occasions and he never even knew i did more than weed theres a lot more to our relationship than im going to explain here so dont judge him he has his issues and i have mine but i decided it was for the better they never knew about her we would hang out at her house or wander around the city or even take her uncles vw bus out into the desert and hang out with her friends her family was a lot more understanding and accepting than mine so they knew about us although they never knew about the ketamine they just knew she smoked weed and did shrooms or acid sometimes but after we got closer we realized we were kinda perfect we never had a single argument and never even once raised a voice to each other during our entire relationship she was perfect and she accepted me for everything i am which i loved her more than anything for i know im the reason she did ketamine and i know im the one that fucked her life over and i have no one to blame but myself for that ive tried to find some way to see it as not my fault but i know it is i have a journal entry in my notes app of everything that happened from start to end that night so i guess ill just put that here i just want everyone to understand just how perfect she was she was the best person i ever knew she cared about literally everyone before herself she was my role model she was beautiful and funny and she could actually enjoy dark humor which i found a lot of people either didnt understand or just thought was insensitive which it probably was but it was still funny you know that one quote you dont know true love until youve lost something you loved more than yourself or something like that thats what this was she was my everything and i know i shouldnt cling to her memory but i dont know what else to do she was so perfect and she meant everything to me i dont want to ramble on too long about all this and bore you to death so i guess ill just put the journal entry here for anybody thats made it this far thank you so fucking much for being willing to listen ok imma finally actually write what happened that night ig so we met up at the building where youre supposed to register for student housing on unm and we skated back to her place and we were just chilling in her room listening to like some music and i even found one of the songs and i got it in one of my playlists now so like thats great ig but anyway we were just smoking a joint cause her parents were pretty chill like they didnt know we did ket or anything but they didnt care if she smoked weed and even occasionally tried like acid and shrooms and stuff so ye anyway we finished the joint and tossed it in the clothes basket she just used as a trash can and turned on some show her dad said we should watch į forget the name of it but it was like late s early s type shit and i whipped out a little baggie of ket i think it was grams but we were both take bumps one after the other dk every time i took one she took one and we were kinda just trying to one up each other the whole night ig cause it was fun but ye we got through i dont even know how much cause i spilled most of what was left on the floor cause i forgot it was in my hand when i fell asleep but at some point we were just like cuddling and all this cute shit and i remember she drew this little doodle of me that i wish i had taken home with me cause it was really good and cute but she said it wasnt symmetrical enough ig so she just threw it away and i didnt feel like pulling it out of the bin cause i was already in a khole so i just layed there and we were making out for a little bit and then she was tired ig so we just went back to cuddling and watching the show and she passed out and i kinda just assumed it was cus she was tired but i got up after a bit and took a piss and did like more bumps in the bathroom and turned the tv off before i got back in the bed with her cus i was supposed to leave at and it was already like and i didnt want to waste my time so i just cuddled with her for a bit and told myself id go home after but i passed out and luckily her dad woke me up at like or so cus he knew my parents didnt know and he didnt want me to get in trouble so he just called into the room to wake me up and i got up pretty fast and i noticed chloe was actually really cold and i got a little scared but i told myself i was just being dumb and she was fine and i got up and and saw the baggie of ket so i just kinda tried to kick it under her bed so he wouldnt see later and threw my hoodie on and left so i could get home before my dad tried to check on me or something and i got home at like and just passed out again but my mom woke me up at like or so and i was already going to pathways and it was a friday and my dad had a meeting early and my mom went in at like so i left at like and skated over to her house to check on her and there was an ambulance out front but she had already been pronounced dead about minutes before i got there and they were just sorting stuff out with her parents i only talked to her dad cause her mom was crying and i didnt want to make her feel even worse so i just told her dad exactly what happened and i expected him to be pissed or something and try to call the cops maybe but he was really chill and he just told me it wasnt my fault but he did say i shouldve told them if we were gonna do stuff like that so they could be on standby and he said he was still disappointed in me but like that didnt change the fact that i still had to deal with it too and he wasnt gonna be angry at me and i kinda just left after that cause i felt like i was intruding and i went home and just fucking stared out the front window for like and a half hours till one of my friends texted me and i just tried to act like nothing happened ig since the friend didnt even know about her anyway but idk i just decided to act like nothing ever happened from there on out ig and i just tried to act like it didnt effect me as much as it did and idk if that helped or not cause now im really shit at interpreting my own emotion as well as conveying them so i still try but like i guess im just dumb cause ye anybody thats made it this far and might have experienced something similar i dont want to forget and i dont want to lose this memory į just dont want to feel so shitty about it i know she wouldnt want me to and so i dont want to but i dont know how thats possible i just need someone to tell me what to do now ig any and all responses are welcome call me an idiot tell me its my fault make me know i couldve stopped it if you so please i know its true just i need someone to know i guess i dont want to live knowing im the only person in my life who remembers her at all cause i didnt fucking tell anybody about us but please just make me know you know sorry for writing so damn much tldr my girlfriend died of an overdose and i know its entirely my fault i hate myself for it,essentially heres happened short knew

1f64dvj,Herb Washing Follow Up,yesterday i asked if you giys washed your herbs overwhelming majority said tjey at least rinsed them i took a couple of these tests and did a side by side comparison i made mojitos unwashed rinsed only rinsed and soaked in vinegar solution rinsed and blanched the recipe was from truffles on the rocks mint leaves measured to be ish grams tbsp sugar oz lime juice lime husk quartered oz don q oz soda i made em all at the same time and tried them the unwashed unfortunately was already a day old and had an old socks flavor to it so it was disqualified the washed only was surprisingly the least flavorful could be an error on my part the vinegar was good but was noticeably more vinegary than the rest the blanched i thought was the best visually not so appealing but the flavor was solid so my takeaway blanching is the best all around it does the most to sterilize and has the best flavor it’s a damned good mojito and probably what i will do from bow on the vinegar while noticeable wasn’t bad and if you like a little extra zing it has potential it also has some antimicrobacterial properties which is great washing only while probably is better than the result i got i just can’t imagine is doing a whole lot in the safe to consume department if it makes you feel better go for it but i’d just assume not bother i think the unwashed mint yesterday yielded better results than any of these but i could get behind blanching i have also read that blanched mint freezes well so imma do that and check back in weeks and see if it holds up visually and fragrance wise for garnishes i’d probably go vinegar for safety or washed this has been somewhat enlightening,yesterday asked giys washed herbs overwhelming majority said tjey least rinsed took couple tests side side comparison made mojitos unwashed rinsed rinsed soaked vinegar solution rinsed blanched recipe truffles rocks mint leaves measured ish grams tbsp sugar oz lime juice lime husk quartered oz oz soda made em time tried unwashed unfortunately already day old old socks flavor disqualified washed surprisingly least flavorful could error part vinegar good noticeably vinegary rest blanched thought best visually appealing flavor solid takeaway blanching best around sterilize best flavor damned good mojito probably bow vinegar noticeable bad like little extra zing potential also antimicrobacterial properties great washing probably better result got imagine whole lot safe consume department makes feel better go assume bother think unwashed mint yesterday yielded better results could get behind blanching also read blanched mint freezes well imma check back weeks see holds visually fragrance wise garnishes probably go vinegar safety washed somewhat enlightening

8rjlrt,I spent a year in a Bangkok prison. AMA!,hello fellow redditors i am doing this ama because every time i mention it i get bombarded with questions and requests to do an ama or tifu people always tell me i should write about it in some form or other but it’s only fairly recently that i’ve been okay to talk about this openly i mean i was pretty fucked up for a good months after getting home mentally and physically also i don’t know where to start with it and i struggle to put it in any kind of context and timeframe because i was completely fucked up on valium for years i’ve been doing really well recently and i can pretty much just look back on it and laugh about it now but also remind myself of the shocking lesson it really did teach me what an absolute debacle the ultimate debacle and hopefully my last plus it’s pretty unique story i guess i mean how many people do you know that have let ladyboys wash their body in a shower in a prison in bangkok go on i’ll wait seeing as today is the year anniversary of my release i guess it’s time to write this story out i’ll give you the tifu and then i’ll answer any question you have in the comments that’s the easiest way to get it out of me i guess tifu by being a reprobate in thailand and getting sent to prison for a year the story really started a few years prior i won’t bore you with that but it was a bad breakup which led me down the road to a nasty benzo addiction with a cocktail of the az of drugs it was pretty dark and to those unfortunate people that know what that’s like you know how depraved it can get i was ruining my life day after day and getting arrested for to stupidest shit one year i was in court separate times that year totally out of character behaviour which i brought on myself there’s at least one news article about me out there eventually my brother dragged me up to london to live with him he kept a keen eye on me and eventually i got a job at a wood yard it was doing kind of alright for a while i was clean and earning money then i got told i need to take my days holiday before june or i’d lose it well it was my birthday at the end of may so i though ‘well fuck spending a shitty expensive night in london with none of my friends imma go to thailand for weeks’ i’ve been to thailand a few times it’s a very familiar place to me particularly koh samui so i booked a ticket and off i went i had a blast a really good time rented a nice suzuki csr and just cruised around a tropical island all days volunteered at a monkey sanctuary and every morning i would drive there and feed baby monkeys then spend the morning grooming and socialising with them i mean you can’t really get better than that i also took tabs of acid and grams of coke with me but that’s a story for another day i will say tripping balls on the side of a mountain with fireworks is pretty sick so the time came to go home i had the coach booked at this point i couldn’t afford a plane ticket from koh samui to bangkok airport oh yeah i also got robbed by a bunch of drug dealers so i got a coach which was cheap and also pretty empty i claimed the entire back row i should mention at this point that because i’m a fucking madman i had booked my return flight to land at heathrow at am i had work that day at am so i was determined to just sleep sleep sleep on the coach i met a kiwi dude we got chatting and at one point he said “dude i’ve got a bunch of valium if that will help” i just though ‘perfect that’s exactly what i need’ i bought a strip off him pills and took a few i slept the entire hr journey and the kiwi guy woke me up saying “man you slept to whole way” i think it was then that i bought a few more strips off him you know because of that addictive personality thing when i got to the airport i realised i was hrs early damn no idea how i fucked that up but shit i gotta sleep i tried to find somewhere suitable to sleep i wondered around for ages while popping more valium i think i passed out for a bit but eventually i was hungry i had a tiny bit of thai baht on me and nothing else i got lunch and here’s their kicker i had a few changs thai beer now alcohol and valium blackout that’s when i would wake up in police cells or in hospital or in a hospital handcuffed to the bed with police officers in the room or maybe even in your own bed with a broken nose covered in dried blood and your own shit yeah it ain’t a good combo would not recommend at this point i’ve taken about mg pills so i’m pretty out of it i check in and entered the departure lounge and just basically wondered around tried blagging my way into all the vip lounges you know standard debauchery i don’t really remember the event honestly but went into a duty free and walked out with a basket of cigarettes whiskey and aftershave as you do i mean i didn’t even know where i was and probably couldn’t tell you my name in that state minutes to my flight i walked away scott free and i remembered realising what i’d done i sat on a seat and shoved the cartons of cigarettes bottles of aftershave and bottle of whiskey in my bag i was kind of worried at that point and starting looking for a place to hide i wandered around looking for somewhere to chill and i ended up lost i approached female member of staff and asked her when x was she got straight on her walkie talkie and told me to wait there oh no i’ve been rumbled this wasn’t my first rodeo in england i’ve got away with all sorts by blagging my way out of it plus in england i’d just be given a fine or a night in a cell and because i was fucking high on valium i didn’t give a shit before i knew it there were police officers on segways surrounding me all armed with big shiny revolvers now i’m describing this situation as an outsider it’s really hazy this whole point but they searched my bag after a bit of reluctance on my part and low and behold a bunch of cigarettes and aftershave with king power stickers on them the king part will be relevant later i got straight on the phone to the embassy they called my mother and we were going to arrange getting the money sent to pay for the goods that’s all they wanted and i could leave and go home thy wanted western union payment okay that’s weird but we’ll do it that way oh what’s this the western union shop is closed now well that’s not an option then my only one so they gave me minutes to pay or be arrested minutes came around and that was it handcuffs on and off we go remember this whole time i didn’t a give a single fuck about what was going on still smiling still happy i was expecting a stern warning or a fine or whatever i’ve talked myself out of worse i couldn’t have been more wrong i was put in a holding cell at the airport had a nice meal the nicest one i would have for the next year then i was transferred to a police cell here are some pictures of my arrest and some pictures on the cell i was shitposting on reddit the whole time people were offering to bail me out a guy actually sent me a westernunion payment for the money but i couldn’t retrieve it he wanted dick pics in return i shit you not if you’re reading this dude thank you and holy shit i owe you some dick pics i only just remembered this as i’m typing it shows how much i’d blocked out of just plain forgot some people reading this will know who i am a bunch of people from a certain subreddit actually found out who i was somehow and were in contact with the embassy they were trying to get me a lawyer or bail or whatever the embassy wouldn’t allow contact without my explicit permission but i didn’t know any of this until i got home proper rhumansbeingbros shit but i digress off i went the next morning to samut prakan prison they can hold you for days without charging you which the will do unless you post bail and you go to court every days they put you in heavy chains literally mm thick steel shackles hammered onto your ankles which you wear for an entire day and you wait all day in a disgusting waiting room that hasn’t been clean ever i thought i was honestly going to die on one of those journeys they crammed us back on the bus after spending an entire day in a shit infested room full of recently arrested tweaking cretins in degree heat they just left us crammed into a bus while they watched a soap opera on tv right in front of us people were passing out around me and i’ve never excreted that much sweat in my entire life we had to fucking scream at the guards to just come and turn the fucking engine on so we can have air con and not die fortunately the embassy got me a good lawyer but they’re not able to bail you out unless you have a shit ton of money in my case about £ the embassy said if you can get bail just leave the fucking country and don’t ever come back i had a really hot translator who was a young internstudent who was rooting for me like mad she turned to me once and said “i steal all the time” she cried when i was sentenced it was well emotional actually now that i think about it anyway i’m rambling on this is my problem about telling this story my sentence was years which is cut in half to if you accept your sentence appeals take months minimum usually over a year so your best bet is to just accept your fate and get on with it that’s the tifu i’ll leave the rest of the questions up to you you can ask me about the conditions the legal system the corruption the people i met the food the sleeping arrangements or those prisonhardened ladyboys i’ll do my best to answer all your questions unfortunately today is also my grandfathers wake it’s a big family gathering so i’m probably going to be telling this story irl all day too bare with me ama,hello fellow redditors ama every time mention get bombarded questions requests ama tifu people always tell write form fairly recently okay talk openly mean pretty fucked good months getting home mentally physically also know start struggle put kind context timeframe completely fucked valium years really well recently pretty much look back laugh also remind shocking lesson really teach absolute debacle ultimate debacle hopefully last plus pretty unique story guess mean many people know let ladyboys wash body shower prison bangkok go wait seeing today year anniversary release guess time write story give tifu answer question comments easiest way get guess tifu reprobate thailand getting sent

4fg1rn,"Vegan nerd out. 50,446 calories, $57.71, 17 days' worth of food from my bi-weekly-ish grocery trip",this post is intended to address three common types of posts on rvegan being vegan is so difficult and expensive what do i buy and i cant cook hey look at me and my vegan haul i gots to get my protiens brah cuz imma athuhlete nbsp the ever popular picture of the food and receipt the data in google sheets to sort as you please nerd it up nbsp eating vegan is neither expensive nor difficult im just a normal guy with a busy life who doesnt want to spend hours cooking cleaning or shopping sure that would be awesome and kudos to those of you that can but i have far too many other hobbies and activities id rather be doing right now this shopping trip is representative of how i shop every weeks it doesnt take much time produces easily prepared meals and is reasonably cheap day at my usual calorieday consumption thats roughly week and i wasnt trying to be particularly frugal if that is your focus it appears fairly simple to drop that cost to week per person well probably less than that since i consume more than the average number of daily calories week is in your reach as for food preparation its easy some examples of how i prepare these foods tortilla with peanut butter tortilla with various combinations of rice beans avocado salsa rice cookercrockpot with various combinations of rice potatoes onions garlic beans saute various combinations of onion potatoes garlic broccoli rotel chorizo baked potato with beans or chorizo or rotel or just salt and pepper nbsp your haul makes a nice picture but is it healthy and economical kick ass fellow vegans shop those vegan goods however i frequently see hauls full of tofakery meats and unhealthy megaprocessed replacements for unhealthy omni foods but why focus instead on regular whole foods theyre cheaper and healthier on the other end of the spectrum i see some monster hauls full of fabulous fresh fruits and veggies im jelly but the larger examples probably cost and provide enough calories for only days and then you need to shop again super healthy yes but also timeconsuming and expensive in contrast some numbers from my shopping trip item data costday caloriesday daily carbsfatprotein grams g g g daily carbsfatprotein percent daily fiber grams days of food healthy balanced economical efficient easy i was curious about the fiber appears to be plenty nbsp ugh protein no you dont need so much im constantly amazed at the number of people who unnecessarily chase protein well perhaps not with how much the meat industry has pushed protein on the us population but we as vegans have usually researched plantbased diets from a health perspective surely you have stumbled across the research regarding the longestlived populations in the world plantbased high carb low protein low fat repeat protein low admittedly plantbased diets are one part of a lifestyle that can contribute to longevity but one which is completely within our control with huge bonuses for the animals and environment of course and for evidence regarding how much protein is needed by athletes a useful metaanalysis is available here which provides data that among elite bodybuilders no benefit has been measured for protein consumption in excess of gpound of bodyweight unless youre an olympic athlete i feel fairly confident in stating that you arent elite and correspondingly your protein requirements are even less than g personal anecdote ive been vegan for over four years have never touched a ped and dont use supplements beyond creatine and vitamins to turn my pee yellow no protein shakes no preworkouts no stacks nothing i lift days a week for hours and play field sports days per week for hours per night my daily protein intake is g for a guy who consumes roughly caloriesday which works out to gpound of bodyweight and of total calories but i can move some weight for example x deadlift nbsp notes and disclaimers for the pedantic yes it is all kcals not cals lets not confuse people fresh fruit prices were high this day i usually pick more fruits than represented here some items i usually grab were out of stock during this trip dry lentils whole wheat pasta sweet potatoes mushrooms raw nut prices are still crazy high i cant bring myself to buy them often thanks california drought i dont really like fake meats soy chorizo but aldi stocks so few vegan items that i feel obligated to purchase it to encourage additional vegan options nondairy yogurt please staple items that arent purchased regularly include salt pepper oil and various spices i used the usda database for unlabeled items check figures on calorie totals indicate that rounding from manufacturers produces some slightly skewed results errors werent egregious enough for me to reviseedit published numbers but if the lack of matching numbers troubles you now you know why,post intended address three common types posts rvegan vegan difficult expensive buy cant cook hey look vegan haul gots get protiens brah cuz imma athuhlete nbsp ever popular picture food receipt data google sheets sort please nerd nbsp eating

dwgpad,[OC][JVerse] Needs of the Few - 3,author’s note this is part of several… in a story set in uhambone ‘s deathworlders story when we last left our heroes they were in a box in the dark with ominous things happening outside my wiki date point slightly less unknown than previously laurie hadn’t ever been one for spelunking but she’d read that it was the most profound blackness available on earth two things therefore caught her unprepared for one the darkness of zero photons impacted her mentally in a way that was unlike anything she’d ever experienced before it was she thought later like suddenly going completely blind except she knew her eyes were still able to see the second thing was just as immediate and far more immediately concerning the grey wall she’d been leaning against while talking with dennis suddenly went away without so much as a warning star treklike fizzle sound or anything one moment it was there and she could see and the next it was gone and she overbalanced with a yelp onto the floor an echoing sound of alarm in a much deeper voice than hers followed suit in nearly the same breath at least the floor was squishy “jesus can you see anything at all” laurie asked into the darkness “pretty sure i’m not actually blind here just feels that way wonder what’s going on that wall musta been some kind of forcefield or something” she heard a scrabbling around “where you at” “um i’m over here” he sounded like he was just a few armlengths away and after a moment their fingers touched both grabbed hold of the other’s hand firmly “i hope that’s your hand there” dennis said after a moment “because if it isn’t and i’m actually on like candid camera or something i’m gonna be pissed” “yeah it is” laurie said she didn’t want to let go “has this ever happened” he let out a shaky laugh “n…no not so much” from somewhere outside of their little world they could dimly hear sounds rapid thumping slow heavy thudding and what sounded like voices that neither could quite make out a deep metallic groan followed by a longwinded bellow in a basso profundo voice preceded silence “what was all of that” laurie asked not really expecting an answer “i’m kinda freakin’ out here no idea man er woman but…” whatever dennis was about to say next was lost as a brilliant blue light stabbed its way into the darkness and a rectangular door opened in one side of what was apparently a single large room their eyes quickly adjusted although they both flinched at the sudden shock…which was then blocked mostly…by… by… “fuck me walking it’s mister snuffleupagus” laurie said out loud it was true the shambling wall of whatever filled the very large door completely and appeared to actually be bending down to peer inside with large wet placidlooking eyes droopy ears on either side of its head but a sort of zoidbergesque nose instead of a trunk and long stripes on either side of its body glimmering an encouraging but hesitant sort of turquoise amid a sea of shaggy brown fur “can you understand me” the face slowly rumbled in a voice laurie could feel in her chest she’d encountered an elephant in the oregon zoo once that had been calling out in the infrasonic range and while this wasn’t nearly that powerful it had the same sort of forceful push against the ribs the colors rippled along its sides a thread of curious pink cautious and concerned yellowish green and encouraging blues mixing with the overall encouragement of the turquoise why am i so sure that’s what that means… laurie thought nearly saying it out loud what came out though was a sort of squeaked “yes…” “good we weren’t sure what they had in here or whether you were sapient or not” mister snuffleupagus said “we’re freeing you they were planning to experiment upon you i think your species is an uncontacted one because i haven’t seen anyone like you before” “frfreeing us” “yes we believe the corti running this facility had intended to ultimately vivisect you along with the others” it rumbled wordlessly for a moment angry streaks of red rippling down its sides “mmmmmmmm…living creatures whether they are sapient or no do not deserve such a thing” dennis leaned over and put one hand to her ear “he sounds like treebeard” he whispered “all hoom homright” laurie gave him an irritated look although she couldn’t see him well in the gloom “come with me” the creature said in its deep voice it moved back out of the doorway and beyond they could see a hallway lit dimly by light sources that were moving around laurie got to her feet and helped dennis up their shaggy liberator had backed up some ways into the corridor and they could see that the lights were mostly being carried along its massive back looking much like the sticklights that they showed in tv shows “you’re not going to like eat us or put things in our butt are you” dennis asked looking around the creature’s sides pulsed a sudden nauseous sickly green “certainly not my people do not eat meat like most sapient races and from what my scanners are telling me i do not think i would survive the attempt to put anything in as you say your butt” the sense of appalled horror was palpable “only the hunters eat the flesh of the sapient” “we don’t know what those are we don’t know what you are” dennis replied “i’m glad not to be vivisected but who are you and why are you freeing us” it gave them a slow placid blink an indecisive mix of violet green and yellow finally giving way to a firmly resolved bright blue playing back and forth “of course uncontacted of course mmmmmmmm…” it rumbled “all will be explained come this way” it painstakingly backed up gingerly into a corner padding softly on huge feet that were almost like hands in the front and once again leslie was reminded of elephants she’d read once about their anatomy and how they walked on their toes with a big pad in the back to spread their weight out the creature’s back feet were sort of like that once it reached a wider spot it began a lengthy elevenpointturn and ultimately they were presented with a massive set of hindquarters clad in deep brown shaggy fur “my deepest apologies for being so slow” it said leading them past several side branches that had glimmering moving lights down them “corti are so much…nrggh smaller than i am that their facilities are always sized too small” it squeezed past something hanging out of the ceiling sending it careening to the side with a clatter “still they can be valuable members of the herd and good friends when they want to be” it spoke slowly enough that they were in an altogether differentlooking place by the time it was finished they passed through a much bigger tubeshaped passage and into a large room lit overhead by a brilliant light that seemed to emanate without source from the ceiling around this much larger room were whitishblue containers in organized rows some with blinking lights on the side attached to what looked like some kind of star trek looking touch panel behind them they heard motion and laurie turned to see another oncoming container much like the others a wavery nothing separated it from the floor looking much like a heatshimmer off asphalt in the sun “your pardon please” came a deep voice from the other side of the container this one was so low that it was almost unclear laurie moved dennis who hadn’t been paying attention back out of the way with an arm and the container followed by another spacesnufflupagus giving it a nudge this way and that with its forehead “well now” another much higher and moreflutingvoice said a short distance away “you found a pair of sapients gurvan” this new speaker was a whitish color with four arms and six legs and a long wavy neck that briefly reminded laurie of something she’d seen in a movie once and muuuuuch taller it was much spindlier moving with the slow grace of the very tall and utterly unhurried it ambled their way from several rows away on feet that turned out to be hooves “i don’t believe your species is in our records” the new arrival said it stepped aside for the container they had just dodged as it was placed in a row with others of the same size and shape “you would probably have difficulty saying my name properly but you may call me ekktl have you ever encountered other races before” “unless you mean those little grey fuckers that have been talking to me no” dennis said his jaw stuck out a little “i got no idea whoor what any of you are where we are or why we’re here can you explain please” “i will do what i can walk with me a little” ithegestured with two arms for them to follow and turned “gurvan would you sweep through the place one more time and be sure we haven’t missed anything i’d like to get going as soon as we have everything loaded since we’ll have a long voyage ahead to put everything back where it came from” their initial guide rumbled something agreeable and trundled back the way they had originally come “perhaps we should start with where you are and why” it cocked its head to look back down at them with one dark eye “you’re currently on my ship the ethical liberator which is located in a star system that doesn’t have any name other than a string of letters and numbers that are wholly inconsequential you were in an unregistered zoological facility conducting unethical unnecessary and probably illegal experimentation on a variety of life forms harvested from whoknowswhere generally this sort of thing doesn’t get the interest of the dominion of course” “you’re space alien greenpeace” said dennis in a sort of unbelievingdeadpan tone “greenpeace” ekktl said “perhaps does your world have such groups” “yeah although i don’t think they’re all that effective most of the big corporations that they target have put a lot of time and money into like staying ahead of them i guess there are a bunch of companies that still do whale hunting for some stupid reason and i know they tried pretty hard to stop that” “interesting we do often find sapients in these facilities when we find them much like you they are usually uncontacted races i make an effort to return everyone we rescue back to their native world but it is not always possible what is the name of your species” “we’re called ‘humans’” laurie said “i take it you have no idea where our world is” “i do notalthough you may rest assured we will search diligently tell me does your species possess the ability to travel faster than light” dennis barked a harsh and humorless laugh “fuck no we only split the atom what sixty years ago or so we have a single space station but it’d take way too long and be way too expensive to do much more than that in orbit using chemical rockets” “i see” the tall gracile alien led them into another large room that looked much like the first but with seats and tables at varying heights instead of boxes or crates the biggest obvious difference however was the lack of a wall on the far side for all intents and purposes it was simply open tonothing but stars and both humans stopped short of going in past the doorway “is something wrong” ekktl asked “this is a rest and relaxation area please come in come in” he waved them forward leading the way in at a deceptively slowfast pace made possibly by unreasonably long legs “there’s no glass” laurie said hesitantly “what’s keeping the air in” the tall alien looked over at the wall of nothing and then looked back at them “it is a simple forcefield you have no such technology i take it” “um no not so much what happens if you lose power isn’t there a backup” laurie thought the alien looked confused “it’s very reliable a matter of solidstate circuitry the rate of failure is impossibly low i can’t imagine why we’d need a physical barrier simply to keep the air in” the two humans looked at each other dubiously and and from dennis’ expression laurie was utterly certain they were thinking the same thing fuck that “you know power can fail” dennis said “come sit i’m sure we have something that’s compatible with your needs even if it’s only nutrition spheres come come” ekktl waved the two of them in with one gracile arm and ambled to a table that had a pair of tall chairs “i hesitate to guessbut from observation i believe you are herbivores i have fresh cqcq” “we’re omnivores dude” dennis said shortly clambering up onto one chair he perched there for a moment and then yelped as the chair shifted around changing its shape to something more comfortable and suited to a human posterior “we eat pretty much everything you are looking at the top of the food chain” laurie climbed up the other chair and sat gingerly the expected change in the chair’s anatomy didn’t take her by surprise having seen dennis’ chair do something similar and it was suddenlyquite comfortable actually “we eat plants and animals though” she clarified to a suddenly somewhatgreenlooking ekktl dennis snickered “we don’t eat any animals that are intelligent” “well there are cannibals so…y’know equal opportunity strikes again” dennis said with a toothy grin “cannibals that term translates as thosewhoeateachother” ekktl said obviously appalled “your people do this” “yes” dennis said at the same time as laurie said “no” more firmly over the top of him “it’s considered wrong by most human cultures” laurie said “my friend here is not being completely honest with you” she leaned over and punched his arm “shut up they rescued us the least you can do is not be a butthole” “i’m just being honest” dennis said obviously unfazed in the least “well we have no meat for you to eat i’m afraid there are a few races in the domain that eat meat but we do not have any of them on board ismeata required part of your diet” ekktl asked obviously trying to be diplomatic about it “some humans are vegetarianssome actually avoid any animalderived products in their diet at all but they’re rare and lots of other humans think they’re weird some humans eat very little plantderived food too because they live in really cold places where it’s hard to grow food” laurie tried to explain with a look at dennis telling him again to shut up the tall alien cocked its head atop its long neck “i thought you said you had not yet traveled to other planets” “we haven’t” dennis replied “why” “i suppose you wouldn’t know the classification of your homeworld by our standards hmmm…” ekktl said the musing sound in its own tongue sounding like a rapidly shaking can of marbles “i know your world has liquid water yes” the humans nodded “our world is covered about by surface water actually” laurie said “although it’s frozen at the polar caps if you put the freezing temperature of liquid water as on a scale and the point at which water boils as on that same scale then the surface temperature of our world varies about fifty degrees both above and below the freezing point of water” there was a long slow blink from ekktl as ithe absorbed that information “thatis impossible” he said finally “that is well into the range of violentclass worlds that we classify as deathworlds no sapient life ever arises there” “yeah no way that’s right besides what is this madeup scale you’re using anyway what is that in freedom units” dennis asked her “the rest of the known universe uses celsius you troglodyte” laurie said with a smile “i can’t help it if you can’t math” “nope i’m stickin’ with ‘murrican measurements that means the temperature is whatever we goddamn say it is and you can’t tell me different or imma rain some freedom on you” they both chuckled “you are serious then this was not a joke that you said about your world” ekktl persisted “i have never heard of a world with that range that would kill most people” “that why you all don’t wear clothes” dennis asked “i noticed the only ones of you all i’ve ever seen with protection against the elements are like that big shaggy guy that we saw first” “gurvan is a guvnuragnaguvendrugun their world has seasonal violent storms because it has several large moons i believe my own world is much more temperate most worlds are” “huh” leslie said an idea struck her “you said most races are herbivores” ekktl waved his head in a gesture she was sure was affirmation “yes carnivorous races are very rare indeed civilization arises much more often in cooperative groups and there are some who believe that meat eaters” he shuddered almost imperceptibly “lack the means to form civilization since you are predators certainly the hunters are uncivilized” “that’s the second time you’ve mentioned them my man” dennis said leaning forward and suddenly intent “what are these hunters” “they are predators who eat sapient beings” ekktl said “fortunately there are not enough of them to pose a serious danger to our entire herd” “don’t you fight back” leslie asked “as much as we are able yes the best way to fight them however is to be where they are not” ekktl replied “so no then” leslie countered “you must understand huntersare not like us they are far far ahead of us technologically and our best efforts to fight back are as a calf fighting adults they primarily stay to their own areas however and only occasionally bother us” “butthey eat you man” dennis said “and your way of dealing with that is for each of you to hope they eat you last” “i suppose that seems very alien to you” ekktl said “for us it is simply how things are and again they rarely come any further than the border systems at all if one is unfortunate enough to live that far out then yes it’s a concern but very few people have ever even seen a hunter ship” “and survived” said leslie “well yes” ekktl replied “you only see them when they want you to and there are never survivors unless they deliberately leave some it’s simply how things are” dennis and leslie looked at one another again “ican’t even imagine dealing with a problem like that that way” leslie finally said “i guess humans are just different than you” “clearly” ekktl said “we were not expecting to liberate any sapients here today i am not sure where your home planet is i don’t suppose you know” they collectively shrugged “i thought not we can drop you at the first trade station then we’re not far outside the main core of domain worlds here” “we don’t even have any money or anything” leslie objected “what the fuck” ekktl recoiled away from the table “what does procreation have to do with this i was certainly not making an offer” “noi mean how arei mean we don’t even have any idea where here is much less anything else i have no idea where earth is or even in what direction it might be oror…” leslie gestured with her hands and then let them fall to her sides “i…” “hey it’ll be okay” dennis said reaching over and punching her shoulder lightly “what an adventure huh we’ll figure it out i doubt there’s many humans out here nobody even knows us fresh start right” he looked around “you said you’d never seen one of us before” he said to ekktl “indeed i have not i did a systems search for your people and found nothing although that is not surprising our ship can only house so much data and it is needed for important things like star charts and so on” ekktl said “i will assign you quarters on board we have some open that we keep empty in case of situations like this i suspect you will find the ability to change the gravity helpful as well we are set to galactic standard which i think is much lower than you are perhaps used to” a similarlooking but shorter bluish creature wandered up balancing a large plate of leafy greens and a bowl of unappetizinglooking grey balls of some kind of dough in one hand and a tray with three small glasses of water in the other it set them down and left without a word ekktl gestured at the plate “they’re cqcq leaves please have some” suiting word to action he reached out a hand plucked two up off the plate and thrust them into his mouth chewing with a sideways grinding motion that looked to both humans like a wellsatisfied goat if goats were white eight feet tall and had four arms anyway leslie hungry and realizing suddenly that she was thirsty too plucked a small handful of leaves up off the plate and tried an experimental nibble they didn’t taste bad she decidedtexture about like notquitewilted spinach crossed with limp lettuce and the taste was about as memorable as a glass of celery water definitely not a good choice for a salad it didn’t have a lot of crunch but it was something and it was solid and it wasn’t the doughy bland nothing of the grey spherethings those were a whole different level of gross she took another handful and offered them to dennis who had popped a couple of nutrition spheres into his face and was determinedly chewing away a defiant expression on his face he shook his head wordlessly with a shrug she chomped them down and was about three chews into it when the two of them both realized at the same time that their host was no longer eating but was staring at the two of them with what they realized was a worried expression “whaff” dennis asked around a mouthful of nutritionsphere gunk “doyou always eat like this” ekktl asked dennis replied by picking up one of the small glasses of water and downing it in one almighty gulp “like what” leslie asked “this isn’t bad for an appetizer but do you have something a little moresubstantial i like a salad as much as the next girl but…” “what is a…salad” ekktl asked grateful for the change of subject matter “it’s a pretty standard type of dish on our world” leslie explained “usually there is a base of something like this and then additional stuff is mixed in and added to it depending on the type like there are salads that have everything from olives and avocados to cheese and then others that are little more than dressing and a little meat” “mmm don’t forget fruit salads or like quinoa” dennis enthused “fuckin’ love quinoa” “yeah that’s a different kind of thing though i was thinking of the lettuce kind” ekktl tried and failed to keep track of the sudden burst of crosstalk “your world has many types of thesesalads” “yeah” leslie said “i always really liked like southwestern stuff with tortilla strips tomatoes avocados olives spiced chicken and maybe a jalapeno ranch dressing” dennis made a noise of agreement as he ate the last of the cqcq leaves on the plate she gave him an accusing look “sorry i was hungry” he looked at ekktl “you got anything more” “how much does your species usually need to eat daily” ekktl asked in what the translator rendered as a disbelieving tone of concern “um…” dennis mused “okay we’d need to have a mutual understanding of measurement to be really accurate so here’s hoping that the translator is able to accurately convey this… using a calorie measurement which is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water one degree on that scale i mentioned earlier adult humans usually need between two thousand and twentyfive hundred calories daily to maintain muscle mass and then there are specific nutritional things we needvitamins and so on” there was a pause while the translator struggled with the conversions ekktl finally reared back in surprise “that is as much as i would need for several days perhaps a week” dennis shrugged “we’re predators man dunno what to tell you” “i do not believe we have the ability to keep you fed with our food stores honestly perhaps for a few days but we will need to expedite getting you to a station with greater food reserves or put you into stasis for the trip” “that’s awkward” leslie said out loud then clapped a hand over her mouth “oh i totally didn’t mean to say that i’m sorry” “like i dunno if i wanna go into cold storage man” dennis said casting a look around “we kinda just got out of being in a tin can you know” “i believe i understand you” ekktl said in what leslie was sure was an attempt at a comforting tone “we would not without your agreement of course but the alternative might be malnourishment or starvation the closest major trading hub is some distance from here” “it’s the best option” leslie said she leaned over to dennis and lowered her voice “you know he’s right we’re gonna starve if we have to depend on eating leaves or whatever and i can’t take much more of those grey sponge things if we don’t what we are going to do is eat all of their food” she sat back up and gave ekktl a tight smile which for some reason he recoiled at “yes we’ll go into stasis” she said “i just hope it won’t be for long” author’s note that

7gowhs,Upcoming Set 4 Review [Spoilers Obvs],whats up guys i hope you guys are staying strong when popcap takes a nap from this game but that doesn’t mean we can’t talk about the next set that may or may not fix the meta right popcap i’m probably going to be wrong but imma pretend i’m right because this is the internet anyway here we go grizzly pear you may remember this from that sweet cub that chills in the water but gets a bump and turns into this mofo that smashes you up it’s like this but without the chillness and most tokens don’t have chill why you might play this instead because you just might be a fp or not know how this game works out of chill bears pumpkin shell this card is for those who like to tempo protect or like to get their fall season on when it’s summer time it’s also great to cover misplays by just playing on top off it so chat doesn’t critique the holy hell out of you could there be better cards than this just like my hopes of a set it’ll be a most likely out of people believing it’s fall primal wallnut aye it’s bubba from prison that i haven’t seen awhile he’s good at blocking staying low from tricks and got the connects for a card draw he ‘ight and can really mess you up with those nut homies quite flexible and looking forward to the pecanolith grape responsibility otk out of years in prison left marine bean popcap wants this ugly fish bean to be useable in aqua decks but forgot to make it a smarty ya wtf this is a guardian card that buffs i mean i guess but like that goes against the class anyway i look forward to my aquatic grass knuckles deck while i’m getting pushed in by a turn evolved fossilhead out of people playing aquatic guardian decks loco coco at first i thought he would kinda suck but then i remembered he works well with mirrornut fidget spinner nut go nuts pecanolith imitator transfig muscle sprout and witch hazel kids be packing their weed sprays so he’s only good in these decks but like that’s all you’re really going to need also slow af out of kids forgot to pack their weed sprays guardian score hot lava it costs so it can be alright can be good in self harm decks so alright it replaces other silly environments so alright i’ll be playing it with transfig so they aint ready for my turn dmd’s or small nuts ehhh out are alright till they aren’t velociradish hatchling see velociradish shelf mushroom shrooms just be smashing ya up fam board too full just fusion it hard to see it in anything else with that synergizing synergy of shrooms out of synergizing the power of shrooms strawberrian berry tribe one step closer to getting dubs that damage could mean everything and not at all but berry blast could claim another victim so we’ll see out want berry dubs velociradish hunter i for one is accepting our new root overlord in the kaboom meta this homie could get your back in a control style as well as get you the dub on the offense pray no field clearing or knockout removal but that won’t happen right out of will playing of these in every kaboom deck unless you one of them fp kabloom score halfbanana banana gods have blessed this token solid stats and on tempo for lily into banana bomber cc got that banana meta coming soon aw yis an actual good token only problem is what you doing without bananas y’know out of banana bombs incoming typical beanstalk just when you thought popcap was on the track for good tokens they pull this one forget it like popcap did about these recent event cards out of will remember this card pea patch poor man’s lilly if popcap savagely murders lily i would give this a holy crap rating but nah it’ll be that one option but not the only option out of will say i’m wrong about this savage spinach this could have savage combos are essentially a better version of onion rings that mess up your hand when capt cucu is pulling that rd soul patch in a row strong tempo ability strong aggro ability you know i’ll try to use it a control and get them dubs out of won’t be using onion rings anymore apotatosaurus this biggie was super scary in the beta like holy crap where are those deadly zombies because they getting smashed up like mike tyson on the juice the nerf is much needed as he aint gonna just go ham on you like that one card with the fossil on his head out digging deep for their deadly zombies mega grow score primal peashooter drop that can swerve harder than that one time i met my ex at a grocery store at the very least it can be hella annoying and great in a bounce deck that be bouncing everything and it miiiight make peas into something out of wish peas were top tier lily pad now you can play double mint in the water with a umbrella leaf next to and watch your opponent play the concede card but that’s not all you can play cut cucu fidget spinner nut banana launcher transfig starfruit and prickly pear on it and watch it do stuff great combos great fun and tons of rage quitting just how popcap plans it out of will be using lily to making crap plants good rotobaga this weird purple root thing gonna be needy when it can only protect other plants gives the fp something to hold hope for dies to anything like that one time i left a succulent out for one day or a week maybe they’ll be some amazing otk thing but i’ll give it to threepeater for that one out of know what kind of plant this is shrinking violet the weed spray of plants because that’s what we’ve been asking for right guys eh it’ll kill imp meta because all impfinitys start with signature power i hate that the attack will make them die so you can’t just leaving out for dead as they become a shell of their former self out of aint gonna play imps anymore and go to fossil head time bird of paradise this one is fun because it has that animal tribe that popcap loves it also conjures a superpower that more likely will be craptastic than helpful because whirlwind and more spore totally wins you games but tryhard will somehow get time to shines in a row regardless out of birds are going to conjure something you can use smarty score lil buddy someone is going to try to make this thing be a win condition guaranteed because it’ll be me with this happy face is going to strike vengeance but most of the time it’ll just be brair fodder out of chump blockers that might win you the game lulz sunniershroom anyone remember that sunny shroom neither did i but popcap didn’t and thus they threw this in because they can a lot of ramp and a lot of tother ramp cards just like my illegitimate child it’ll be forgotten out of shrooms have seen better sunnier days eyespore cheap hard removal that’s not too hard to do and a plant if you can’t instantly good and gonna make the zombies invest a lot of their hopes and dreams to only see this kill it out of zombie tear collectors sun strike otk chompzilla that doesn’t care about chump blocks is here just like bmr on turn it’ll be somewhat easy to anticipate but it’s gonna get ya dubs if you have the right plants on board out of can see chompzilla actually be aggressive aloesaurus i said to myself that dino gonna be a healing brex and surprise it is i also said it’s gonna be slow and come back from behind like what most chompzillas and roses do when you’re smashing them up like mcgregor vs mayweather that’s a bet i’ll never get back out of told me not to make that bet solar score here’s an intermission for the zombie side because i can’t believe i’ve made it this far and to also see if you’re still reading this if you are congrats but i ‘m not giving any rewards also i can’t wait to read about all the responds about how wrong i am and i should go back to playing otk cardboard zombie because i actually was playing that intermission over goat the mvp of the game think about it it’s name is literally goat that’s goat the greatest of all time bar none this wins this kills this gets you hella bank don’t get him in packs craft him because he’s worth every spark popcap doesn’t say it but if you get of them on board it summons exodia the goat god and saves your grandfather from the shadow realm out of said it isn’t possible but it is oh yes it is vengeful cyborg “tokens get the kids going” popcap said as it doodles out it’s robotic eye “maybe we should make more original cards but that sounds like work and ea ain’t made out of money but nah this’ll do now how can we make them forget about that faster battle button that isn’t going to happen” as popcap ponders outside the rustling winds of seattle out of wants more of this popcap fan fiction killer whale i could just copypaste my review of lily pad here but let’s imagine placing zombies in the most of a killer whale with all these other spots i can finally fulfill my wish of placing ra zombie in the water out of will put the right zombie in that whale’s mouth hunting grounds new environment that is useable and creates and new strat all for it as they aint ready for cardboard zombie with hunt the last time i went hunting was trying to find a white castle in ohio got lethal through frenzy so it was a good day as ice cube would say out of people don’t hunt like i do gargantuarthrowinggargantuar we needed big dudes riding on top of other big dudes that could throw big dudes into smashing your opponent boog garg gonna be insane with the goats with this and firework zombie kids ain’t ready for the garg tossing hopefully they don’t get you frankentuar or swabbed shower dude uggh out of say this is too slow and doesn’t work with goats but they just haters beastly score mustache waxer mustache ramping intensify i mean that guy looks so harmless but he’ll go savage once you drop them staches he aint on the level like the professional zombies but he’s fair he’s balanced and not going to make this sub into the salt mine for my fries out of can’t even grow a stache and thats a real shame pirates booty zoo and pets might make it work or it’s just gonna be that one card that only sounds good on paper definitely not on the level pot of gold not even snoop dogg would enjoy it out of say im being too optimistic mustache monument apparently this bypasses graves so savage with mug and other bonus attacking type zombies of course this would be brainy the love child class of popcap so many combos like you would have to be trying to make this bad out of because brainy class duckstache more stache hype and this class equivalent of fossil head this guy looks liked my old teacher after spending a lot of time in the back room and wondered why he smelled funny he can conjure too because why not out of best looking set card zombot dinotronic mechasaur i feel this is more a meme card for me so you’ll know he’s gonna be favored here he’s riding a robo dino kinda slow and can conjure the other dinos imagine teleporting this guy in and dropping a mini bmr i’ll sure get some walks with him too out of for being everyone’s favorite shamrock target brainy score trapper territory this is a crazy environment card that came from a sneaky card okayyyy work well with shark and cheap removal environment so it has some usability could trap harder than my cousin tho out of out in the trap game disco dance floor is overshoot worth it ehh it’s for dancing and zoos i guess i’m not in love with it and neither am i with disco after that one accident out of say this has been a great review post so far lmao grave robber zombie not on con man’s level of op but solid in both pirates and gravestones i don’t pirate things much except music movies baseball tickets and books but that’s not the point this is a good card out of wouldn’t download a car zombies best friend boog pets holla at your boi or at least in zoos the conjures could be insane he looks hella dumb so imma dock a point out of think it’s zombie scooby doo headhunter imo worst zombie legendary of the set dancing just doesn’t catch a break and this dude doesn’t even have a spear with a decapitated plant head on it how tf can you be called headhunter without a decapitated head smh popcap out of just instantly upvoted this post crazy score leftovers why do they cost the buffs are weaker than when my gram gram fell down the stairs and asked for help some say she’s still down there leftovers weak sauce that you find in a mcdonald’s bathroom out of disappointed lost colosseum hella good stats and sports why shouldn’t you play this i mean people went to war in that colosseum and it was inhumane and rad just like this out of agree hearty just might be too good knockout briar rose gonna get dropped flowers period gonna get dropped arguably best removal in the game is here if mike tyson was a removal card it is this i can’t say anything bad about this out of this will be our new removal overlord turquoise skull zombie this guy used to be cool and now after all the nerfs he’s pretty meh at least it’s a better ra zombie poor ra just kill popcap please he’s suffered too much out of nails in ra zombie’s coffin chum champion great effect meh stats but sports it’s gonna be the sports meta all over again it reminds me that one time that i tried sports it was bad and never did again no regrets out of athletic careers crushed hearty score monkey smuggler budget option for gravestones and pets that has good stats bubbles the monkey is here as well sneaky gets them going out of have even more gravestones to memorize buried treasure i like it for the potential memes and the treasure reminds me of that time i got kicked out of disneyland because jack sparrow has no chill out of times i’m going to get even with jack sparrow excavator zombie yo this thing might be too good with all the removals it does even more removals than it’s cost might be worth like wow why not have this grave digger dave got competition out of bouncing sneaky meta is coming back unthawed viking only freezing zombie and it kinda meh poor cryo maybe i’m being too harsh but im not looking forward to it looks cool tho but odin would be disappointed out of are hanging on to a cryo yeti deck raiding raptor now i remember this due in the beta he was so good i would say he might be op and popcap saw that as well now he only buffs attack instead of health as well so he’s ok but not an instant go to drop might be a solid otk method we’ll see what combos can come up out of anticipating the next jurassic world movie sneaky score for funsies the best classes based on the scores i’ve given were smarty at and beastly at the worst were guardian at and crazy at alright that’s all of set and it was a lot more difficult than i thought it would be if you scrolled down to this part then go back because it’s worth it also feel free to fight my opinions in comments i’ll be waiting,whats guys hope guys staying strong popcap takes nap game mean talk next set may may fix meta right popcap probably going wrong imma pretend right internet anyway go grizzly pear may remember sweet cub chills water gets bump turns mofo

ajhvnq,"An introduction to Terror Jr, the enigmatic ""pop supergroup""",in honor of debut album unfortunately terror jr coming out tomorrow here is an introduction to the group nbsp who are they terror jr consists of singer lisa vitale aka lisa terror and producers campa david benjamin singervine and previously felix snow who are known for producing kiiara’s gold snow left the group in late the trio joined forces in to form their selfproclaimed pop supergroup whose music is characterized by distorted vocals sexual or provocative lyrics and dark and dreamy production that is slightly reminiscent of pc music their imagery can be described as purple kitschy retro and most importantly grapey in this post i will walk you through their discography and career nbsp the start kylie rumors and bop city the first song that terror jr released was three strikes which they debuted in a kylie cosmetics lipgloss commercial kylie jenner had just started out with her cosmetics brand so people were definitely hyped when she released this commercial and immediately people started wondering about the song that it featured terror jrs image was very mysterious literally no one had heard of terror jr before this because they did not exist the band was said to be a social experiment of some sorts and the identity of their front woman who only went by lisa was unknown this last fact caused a search for the identity of this mysterious figure and rumors started going around that it was kylie jenner herself – why else would they debut in her video at some point the rumors got so bad that kylie addressed the situation on snapchat stating that she was in fact not the lead singer but some remained skeptical meanwhile the group kept up their mysterious image for example by answering every question in a teen vogue interview with grape emojis nbsp their released their first ep “bop city” on october featuring fresh production and sexy lyricism this is still my favorite ep of theirs i love every song on it highlights are nbsp come first their most accessible song to date a chill bop about being treated as in the relationship and in bed was later remixed with lil b choice lyric cause it’s great that you want me but i come with a warning so imma be real with you i know what i need sugar a bouncy bop with pc musicesque production imo one of their best songs to date choice lyric i ain’t a model you ain’t in gq i guess we hit the fuckin’ lotto strikes another chill bop characterized by its heavily distorted vocals choice lyric can you hold me down for one night like i got three strikes nbsp showing variety bop city in november terror jr released their first music video for heartbreaks which notably does not feature any of the group members the song marked a departure from their sound on their first ep the group announced their second ep “bop city terrorising” which came out in june almost twice as long this ep showed a lot more variety from the group highlights are nbsp heartbreaks – another one of my personal faves it features an unusual song structure with no clear chorus as the title suggests the song details a breakup choice lyric and my personal breakup mantra my heart breaks but i don’t caramel – the songs lyrics reference violence plastic surgery trump gay rights women’s rights drug use and more choice lyric holy spirit i can feel it in my cervix but they wanna shut me down like my pussy’s fucking worthless sweatpants – this one is not a single but one of my personal faves and a good example of the sillier side of terror jr’s lyricism the song is about not feeling at home in the fake la culture of plastic surgery drug abuse and flexing for the gram and rather just being comfortable chilling in sweats with a small circle of friends choice lyric fuckin hoes with my sweatpants on ooh ooh get over it im a comfy bitch nbsp a new start felix snow’s departure lisa’s reveal bop city and more shortly after the release of their second ep the group announced their third “bop the girl who cried purple” it was released in september only months after bp before the release the group announced their grapeland tour and on the poster true identity of lisa terror was finally revealed as fans had suspected it turned out to be lisa vitale a former youtube cover artist who had only ever released two original songs on the final bop city ep terror jr continues where bp left off painting a “poignant picture of youth culture” as nylon described it characterized by materialism shallowness and a juxtaposition of hope and boredom the least “boppy” of the trilogy and honestly my least favorite highlights include nbsp fight and fuck a song about longing for “a reason to breathe” in an age of shallow relationships and materialism choice lyric no i dont think well ever be okay and baby thats okay holding your tongue – the ep’s lead single and the boppiest song on the ep which is generally more chill because of that the single which is about a failed relationship is also more reminiscent of the earlier eps staring at someone im supposed to love but all i see is nothingness nothingness in late producer felix snow departed from the group to focus on other projects the remaining members decided to continue with the group and released a christmas bop titled “sad sad girl” in december nbsp leaving bop city unfortunately terror jr in the duo worked on their track debut album which as said will release tomorrow from the album they released “heaven wasn’t made for me” “aok everything’s perfect” “pretty” and “kinda iconic” as singles a notable shift from earlier work is that the lyrics have a more explicit political message than before and their production is more gpfriendly as an example nbsp heaven wasn’t made for me – the song is a critique of christianity or organized religion clock the bible quote about the position of women in the outro it has terror’s first video that actually features the group prominently choice lyric if theres people youve gotta hate for loving what they made for loving who they came for then heaven wasnt made for me nbsp thank you for reading my short introduction to terror jr hope

5n37uq,"M/28/6'0"" [225lbs > 165lbs = 60lbs] So I lost some weight",hey reddit thought i’d share as this was a great source of motivation for me while there are plenty others here that have seen way more success hopefully this helps a few of you i proposed to my now wife back in august of and in february ’ i knew i decided if i was going to to get in shape for our upcoming wedding september ’ i needed to get going i fluctuated between large and extra large growing up but was very active in sports so remained pretty athletic through college once i started rocking a desk job the active part began to subside and i shot up to my heaviest around instead of jumping right in i decided that i would go in stages to i guess lessen the blow to my lifestyle i started by doing research i read about different sustainable diets working to better understand what i was eating and how it impacted my body in the past i had tried keto with success but i also found it very difficult to maintain thus the yoyo of weight fluctuation starting in march i felt ready to commit i used a vacation to seattle as my starting stopping point had a great trip and came home ready the goal was to look good in wedding photos and i had a date i had to get there at my heaviest on my wedding day i joined a gym a crossfit one specifically based off trying them out for a month and really enjoying the workouts environment etc my local has some great trainers that worked closely with me starting out to modify workouts to my skill level along with providing constant instruction on my form i bring that up because i think without it i would not have stuck with it or injured myself doing it wrong seriously investing in this was without a doubt why i kept going at first i would go days a week and within a month and a half i was up to days depending on my workload i went in the evenings either the or workout depending on when i could get out of work i regret not tracking my strength throughout i definitely lost some musclestrength with the weight loss i’ll get into that in a bit but would have loved to see my lifting ability compared to weight over time i track my stuff now but just started and need to build baselines and then will share so thats the gym stuff but really i think my biggest impact came from my diet i broke my diet into a few categories that made the most sense to me the typical of carbs fat and protein but i also paid special attention to sugar overall i found a pretty compelling case for why sugar is bad for you and that greens are pretty fucking tasty while i love me a steak i did trim red meat out quite a bit burgers went out the door along with really ground beef in general i substituted turkey ate a lot of chicken breasts and honestly for about months think i ate a salad for lunch every day salmon and broccoli was one of my favorite dinners i paid special attention to eating fresh i think without having kids my fiancé and i could focus more on cooking so i didn’t mind getting ingredients and cooking fresh vs buying processed that is what really drove down sugar consumption it’s amazing what all has added sugar naturally occurring in something like fruit no worries we also cut things like pasta out and subbed squash or zucchini typical food breakfast egg whites spinach two slices of turkey lunch salad romaine with low fat dressing chicken edamame peas i seriously ate that for around months dinner some meat or fish chicken breast or salmon and broccoli zucchini noodle or spaghetti squash kind of thing i did start to implement some protein shakes directly after the gym or as a substitute for breakfast in the morning current typical food breakfast scoop protein powder unsweetened almond milk and a banana lunch cup kale cup brussel sprout with sunflower seeds and a light dressing ounces sliced turkey midday grams of carbs typically an oatmeal or sweet potato type preworkout shake heading into gym post workout protein shake dinner ounces protein cup of greens grams of carbs if i get hungry few ounces of turkey sometimes i love me a bowl of cereal late at night my biggest issue is that i ran at a pretty extreme calorie deficit i think part of this was on purpose because i knew i had a deadline while another part due to not tracking calories like i should have i used a calorie tracker but was not great at updating it i’ve since adopted a different diet i’ll go into it and am tracking macros i think i could have seen similar results while retaining muscle had i focused more but honestly it didn’t kill me and i’m healthier than i’ve ever been so meh so my current routine has me at the gym around days a week i’m eating based on macros following the renaissance periodization program and have seen success my goal is to get to maintain and drop more body fat stats at start weight height ’ body fat at peak weight height ’ yay not shrinking body fat current weight height ’ woooo body fat holidays were fun i’m not going to be a robot something i think was important for me to comes to terms with even if it means delaying goals coming to terms that i want to be healthy but over the christmas time my family eats and imma get down on some cheesecake and general terrible for me but delicious food my family makes back at it and working towards a healthy my energy is higher i love being able to pop out of bed in the morning and as the bigger guy for most of my life it’s pretty cool being called skinny would do again some additional pictures start to wedding week new years new years,hey reddit thought share great source motivation plenty others seen way success hopefully helps proposed wife back august february knew decided going get shape upcoming wedding september needed get going

asyjda,Three Generations of 'Sweet Bippy WHAT',hey folks ive been reading rjustnomil for about the last two months without an account and after mulling over whether or not to do this im going for it so congrats yall have my first ever post but birb i hear folks say after a moment what do you mean three generations of sweet bippy what well i mean family shenanigans that could use a heck of a lot more fuckwords to describe them cause some of this is look at this tangled web we weave territory and some of it is if it wasnt against the laws of this land i would fight you where you stand and yes all of this is my foo xb so lemme give yall a rundown of three generations of my family oldest to youngest mostly a highlight of bec moments because some things were experienced first hand while other things were shared with me by the other people on this list feel free to suggest names because otherwise i am going to borrow from metal albums without shame to name these folks if i decide to post again with more shenanigans apologies for length but this has been stewing for years xb great grandma she is spiteful great grandad died near the tail end of the searly s she blames him for dying on her currently in her early s and clings to that with her claws running joke is if the good die young shell never die retired still living at home vlc at most maybe once a month once every two months because family sg to her own mother with gc brothers but this is based on family rumors partially confirmed by info given to me by mom she constantly told me from about th grade to th grade that the only way i would get into college was if i stuck with the orchestra program in school for a scholarship i had pretty darn close to a breakdown when the th grade director was a pretty horrible person and i have to impress my family i have to uphold the family name dear redditors i read too much fantasy fiction as a kid and internalized too much disney we have no big family name brain stop latching onto that i was only allowed to quit because my mom told her hey birb cried his eyes out over a scholarship that doesnt even exist yet and the director is horrible bc ive met her let this poor birb go my word did not matter until mom backed me up gram mentions to great grandma offhandedly like ish oh birb has a friend whos trans because gram is an enabler and will sacrifice folks if it means that she a has something to talk about with great grandma and b is something she considers minor proceeds to call my friend an it gram later assures mom and i that oh she just says things to get a rise out of people fun fact i too am trans and yall still dont know it because of that moment oh we just need to take birb to the mall and go on a shopping spree get him some skirts or dresses get him some makeup maybe then hell be a proper young woman this was in high school a few years ago before i figured things out and even now i still want to s c r e a m she wanted mom and gram to more or less snatch me from doing shit leave me in the same room with her and ill become a proper s lady obviously s on the flipside when i had to go to a wedding a few years ago she went oh but what if birb wore this proceeded to suggest that my year old self should dress like something off a trashy mystery cover which is all about the clingy turtlenecks high boots and short skirts yeah no this is pure bec or perhaps just straight up wtf territory but she bought a horse painting a few years ago and said with a straight face theres just something so erotic about this it is a head shot of a horse and its flowing mane please stop she wants to make a mark on my life and said i should go to the funeral of a family member ive never met for experience because at that point in my life i wanted to hardcore be a writer unsurprisingly i did not go she would deliberately tell gram one thing and mom another thing they proceeded to share information with each other because pffft thats dumb not to she also has admitted to playing scenarios in her head to figure out what might happen now this is not a slight or a diagnosis of any kind i bring this up becomes sometimes she will honestly believe a scenario happened and she had a conversation that didnt play out the way it actually did this happens very rarely but often enough that it is quietly worrying as well as frustrating xb gram nerves incarnate to some degree will sell someone out because well i just needed something to talk to my mother about currently in her early s still working i am currently living with her and mom she was the sg with two gc younger brothers but because she lives closer to great grandma now she has some degree of gc status theres a running joke between the family that if you dont answer your phone you must obviously be dead in a ditch somewhere thats because a few years ago in her eyes if you didnt answer a call or text immediately you must be dead why else wouldnt you respond to her text the second you got it fun fact she wont look at her texts for hours but if you call her she picks up immediately and doesnt even acknowledge you texted mmm i love hypocrisy for dinner so recently moved to live with her again because life blew up reasons re birb and mom gtfo of a bad dealio shes made it habit to yell honey im home because tailend of i was doing college things online if i do not respond immediately something must be wrong yesterday i went out with mom to do a thing and she was so worried when i didnt reply it must be bad she was so worried when she walked back there and saw only the cat on your bed but oh you must be fine because she saw you had used the shower and could smell your soap not creepy or infuriating at all dear redditors not at all s this was relayed to me today as something she told mom last night and was in fact what spurred me to write this finally lived with gram and mom from birth to about before mom met step father sf and we moved in with him hoarders wonderland got fixed when i was about or then proceeded to go downhill again doors were not really a thing in the house welcome to curtain land nerds and at least two dogs at all times returned in summer of the hoarding has gotten worse back office is full of things she had in a storage unit currently has three storage units rented and when mom and i went through food she had things from in some places also guess what she still has two dogs who are not trained in the least welcome to pee land losers have fun cleaning it up because she wont i told her not to tell great grandma that i was taking guitar class in guess what i heard from great grandma next go on guess the only water shell drink is dasani and how dare you if you expect her to drink something thats swill of a lesser kind same with coke how dare you expect shell drink anything else pepsi just doesnt taste right waaaaah her opinion is the right one and if you even say otherwise time for her to be a five year old getting butt hurt we got into a disagreement recently over when a specific historical thing happened and she just kept hammering at her opinion until mom googled and went lmao naw this is pure bec but i am currently the one doing things so she can bite me bought plants in the last two weeks she puts them outside for an hour before bringing them back inside because weather has yet to water them mom watered them and they need to have sun for hours so to yoink myself out of a bad sleep schedule and a longterm down mood i walk the plants i have to take care of shit she bought and then proceeded to neglect this carries over to general house things for both mom and i like cleaning the floor doing garbage recycling dishes etc mom was hospitalized a few years back for a few days close to my birthday for something nonlife threatening gram immediately took me to her home shoved me in my old room because i just cant stand the thought of you alone at night i was at the time and sf worked nights also hey fun thing spending two straight days in a row next to moms bedside because we need to be here every second totally doesnt make a guy paranoid his mother is dying not at all s mom suffered something similar last year but hey surprise surprise because she knows how to handle it now she said birb thing is happening but dont worry so i didnt it was over in a night and gram was yelling from a few states away when she heard same thing for when i came down with something january in she was ready to stay a month and help us with everything mom said no and i didnt get surgery until midfebruary i am shock of all shocks still alive and hoping that froederick the tumor is suffering in science hell xb mom she is a sometimesjustno but folks its been a long few years and i have to yell about parts of this somewhere early s currently working i am currently living with her and gram only child but with numerous cousinsnieces and nephews she gets kind of looked down upon by other family because a had me as a single mother b has multiple piercings and tattoos c wants to divorce my sf since summer of she was the sg to the gc male cousin in her age range when she was younger i bet yall can see a pattern by now when it comes to sg vs gc last summer bailing from a bad sitch re sf being a giant tool bag i was pretty much her emotional support and had been her emotion support since i moved back in with them in i was her emotional crutch and there wasnt always an equal giveandtake on that front i still have to act as that because the sitch is still partially ongoing she can yell and cry all she wants but when i do it well sometimes it has to relate back to her or else its time to hear reassurances that still feel quietly dismissive came out as trans to her in fall of her immediate question was about surgery my dudes imma scream im not even on hormones yet cause i am that deep undercover in straight land i spoke nothing about it to her again until summer of after sf hijinks had ensued and things had cooled for a bit did pretty much minor things like shortening my birth name to the first letter while trying to get my attention and sometimes using kid instead of daughter reiterated at a pride thing in fall of that i was trans got butt hurt i hadnt shared the fact that i had a name semipicked to this damn day she still calls me daughter to my face and the most acknowledgment i get is sometimes shell send me screenshots of trans things on instagram because of people she follows and shows me dress shirts besides surface level shit its meaningless gestures to some degree and not gonna lie i do wish they meant more look on one hand i will admit to enabling this behavior but on the other i was a miserable teenager who hated life in high school in like my mental health was tanking and things were just bad she hated her job at the time and could fake being sick i knew how many days off i had from classes per semester before it started hurting my grades shed yoink me from class and wed run away and yeah it was some degree of fun but shes still doing it now five years later this is not sustainable habit and its kind of messed up some of her jobs before xb so yeah three straight generations of sweet bippy what from great grandma down to mom id like to restate that mom falls more into the sometimes just no category but being used as her emotional crutch is currently something thats eating at me with gram and great grandma thats a much longer time span of things they have done that are actually kind of messed up looking back on it and if i can remember some of the other things theyve done i might share them later on i say if i can because so much has been swept under the rug for years alongside being normalized to the point where its hard to tell that it isnt anymore xb,hey folks ive reading rjustnomil last two months without account mulling whether im going congrats yall first ever post birb hear folks say moment mean three

5xetpc,One Year Progress: A Break In Open Posts,i posted this in rprogresspics but wanted to share it here as my routine has been heavily influenced by crossfit hope this helps motivate some others hey man i posted about mine but here is a snip i proposed to my now wife back in august of and in february ’ i knew i decided if i was going to to get in shape for our upcoming wedding september ’ i needed to get going i fluctuated between large and extra large growing up but was very active in sports so remained pretty athletic through college once i started rocking a desk job the active part began to subside and i shot up to my heaviest around instead of jumping right in i decided that i would go in stages to i guess lessen the blow to my lifestyle i started by doing research i read about different sustainable diets working to better understand what i was eating and how it impacted my body in the past i had tried keto with success but i also found it very difficult to maintain thus the yoyo of weight fluctuation starting in march i felt ready to commit i used a vacation to seattle as my starting stopping point had a great trip and came home ready the goal was to look good in wedding photos and i had a date i had to get there at my heaviest on my wedding day i joined a gym a crossfit one specifically based off trying them out for a month and really enjoying the workouts environment etc my local has some great trainers that worked closely with me starting out to modify workouts to my skill level along with providing constant instruction on my form i bring that up because i think without it i would not have stuck with it or injured myself doing it wrong seriously investing in this was without a doubt why i kept going at first i would go days a week and within a month and a half i was up to days depending on my workload i went in the evenings either the or workout depending on when i could get out of work i regret not tracking my strength throughout i definitely lost some musclestrength with the weight loss i’ll get into that in a bit but would have loved to see my lifting ability compared to weight over time i track my stuff now but just started and need to build baselines and then will share so thats the gym stuff but really i think my biggest impact came from my diet i broke my diet into a few categories that made the most sense to me the typical of carbs fat and protein but i also paid special attention to sugar overall i found a pretty compelling case for why sugar is bad for you and that greens are pretty fucking tasty while i love me a steak i did trim red meat out quite a bit burgers went out the door along with really ground beef in general i substituted turkey ate a lot of chicken breasts and honestly for about months think i ate a salad for lunch every day salmon and broccoli was one of my favorite dinners i paid special attention to eating fresh i think without having kids my fiancé and i could focus more on cooking so i didn’t mind getting ingredients and cooking fresh vs buying processed that is what really drove down sugar consumption it’s amazing what all has added sugar naturally occurring in something like fruit no worries we also cut things like pasta out and subbed squash or zucchini typical food breakfast egg whites spinach two slices of turkey lunch salad romaine with low fat dressing chicken edamame peas i seriously ate that for around months dinner some meat or fish chicken breast or salmon and broccoli zucchini noodle or spaghetti squash kind of thing i did start to implement some protein shakes directly after the gym or as a substitute for breakfast in the morning current typical food breakfast scoop protein powder unsweetened almond milk and a banana lunch cup kale cup brussel sprout with sunflower seeds and a light dressing ounces sliced turkey midday grams of carbs typically an oatmeal or sweet potato type preworkout shake heading into gym post workout protein shake dinner ounces protein cup of greens grams of carbs if i get hungry few ounces of turkey sometimes i love me a bowl of cereal late at night my biggest issue is that i ran at a pretty extreme calorie deficit i think part of this was on purpose because i knew i had a deadline while another part due to not tracking calories like i should have i used a calorie tracker but was not great at updating it i’ve since adopted a different diet i’ll go into it and am tracking macros i think i could have seen similar results while retaining muscle had i focused more but honestly it didn’t kill me and i’m healthier than i’ve ever been so meh so my current routine has me at the gym around days a week i’m eating based on macros following the renaissance periodization program and have seen success my goal is to get to maintain and drop more body fat stats at start weight height ’ body fat at peak weight height ’ yay not shrinking body fat current weight height ’ woooo body fat holidays were fun i’m not going to be a robot something i think was important for me to comes to terms with even if it means delaying goals coming to terms that i want to be healthy but over the christmas time my family eats and imma get down on some cheesecake and general terrible for me but delicious food my family makes back at it and working towards a healthy my energy is higher i love being able to pop out of bed in the morning and as the bigger guy for most of my life it’s pretty cool being called skinny would do again some additional pictures start to wedding week new years new years,posted

now how many cellies my baby mama did you join a gang which one been a crip since my youth when im locked up i clique up with o you say you have people to feed so how are you feeding them from the inside locked up right now but i do the same thing i do when im out take from the weak and flip on the outside a gram of weed is say on the inside it goes for pretty much double you say you wont tolerated being disrespected and i can understand this when locked up but that attitude doesnt work on the outside so whats your plan to change that mind set when you get out attitude does work on the outside im a man of morals if you dont have morals you aint a man if you stand in my chest and say fuck me imma bat you in your shit so hard you wont see straight for a week and if i dont im a hoe whats the one single thing you dont have in your cell that would make your time more tolerable my profanity but some ass big brother if i could just get lil ole thick red bone with an ass like a horse i swear to god imma put a welcome home doormat in front of more cell lmao whats the one single thing in your cell they could take away that would make your time unbearable window id lose my mind if they took window out whats your favorite thing to eatdrink from the commissary buns when i was young i used to be a lil fat boy i got older and thinner but i still got the same taste buds whats your favorite recipe to make from items bought from the commissary is more big brother im happy with a bowl of ramen little bit of barbecue sauce maybe some mayo and the seasoning do you have a job in the prison if so do you like it an official one ill wipe down the tables in the pod when asked but thats it whats your main hustle inside a dog eat dog world if you weak you gotta submit to the strong if you got a sweet mama whos putting a lot of money of your books youre paying for my shit i could easily ask more questions so ill stop there away i enjoyed answering your questions sorry for the confusion about preying on the weak what would someone have to do to get you to leave them alone something about it if im fucking with you and you dont do shit imma continue if you steal off on me youre gonna get your ass beat but ill fuck with you after if someone cant beat you in a fight what are some ways they could earn your respect dont have to beat me just show that they wont be pushed around and ill respect you as will most so what does that come down to body language saying no having other people behind them off nobody is going to be behind the person in jail you dont interfere if i was getting into it with someone and someone else stepped in youre both getting jumped usually we would fight on until we were done and settled our differences thats the end of it but if you want to jump in all of mine finna jump in you gotta swing on me by yourself words dont do shit in there my man all action forgive me if any of this is inappropriate jacket got everything from petty theft to assault and battery with a dangerous weapon with intent to murder if youd like me to go into it more just let me know what is your rap sheet can be hard sometimes but for the most part im used to it ive been in and out of the system so much its almost a second home if i get stressed out i take my aggression out through working out how do you cope with not being able to do whatever you want when ever you want all i can do big brother i dont want to be a menace to society but its all i know i got people to feed with no way to provide legally and i wont tolerate disrespect by any means those two things is a bad combination what compels you to commit crime love to be able to live a normal with my children thats all at this point whats your dream now problem my man thank you for taking the time to ask some questions may peace be upon you can someone come into prison just for an example a white dude who has no gang affiliation and got in for growing and successfully make it without much trouble if he just keeps to himselfdoesnt get involved with the hierarchy sir he just needs to respect himself and everybody around him thanks so much for doing this i really appreciate it you for taking the time to ask questions whats your dream job anything is on the table always wanted to have my own bbq restaurant so if i could do anything id have my own bbq spot would i be scared shitless to be walking towards you you walking towards me on an otherwise empty block yeah probably it depends ive had people say they were scared when they first met me and others who said they could tell i was a good guy the minute they saw me even beneath my appearance im thugging so probably lol what needs to change about the prison system to make it such that people come out ready to stay out get a job etc cant think of a way employers dont want to hire you if youve been convicted of anything basically so something would need to change there most of us just want a way to provide for our own thats all what is the most vile part of incarceration in your view the greatest part throw shit and piss at each other thats pretty vile the greatest is probably the hierarchy theres a pyramid if your weak youre at the bottom and the strong are at the top ive read all your responses and i just wish there was some way to get through to you and people like you that your macho attitude isnt worth it because all it does is get you locked in a cage like an animal while people with real respect and power look at you and and laugh at how much of an idiot you are i was in jail for a little while and it seemed like everyone there had your attitude instead of worrying about literally being there in person for your family providing for them without fucking other innocent people over you choose to get in trouble over someone disrespecting you so my question is do you ever plan to change that mindset brother with all due respect you dont know shit you probably went to jail and made bail in an hour probably didnt even make it past intake get locked down in the maximum security block of a city jail then tell me im an idiot yeah its fucked up i have to live by this mindset but thats the way things are to survive in that environment in the title it says murders rapes assaults ive seen it all key words are ive seen it its never happened to me because i know how to conduct myself in a room full of killers fresh of the street edit i gotta throw in you are not a man of morals if you take from those weaker than you that makes you a coward its a dog eat dog world big brother if you got something i need im taking it from you if you dont like it come kill me its really not that hard its simple why would i fuck with someone who would put up a problem when i can go get the same thing from a hoe who will role over the minute i raise my voice i understand where youre coming from but lets be real how would you want the people in your life on the outside to show that they are thinking of you or make the time easier picking up the phone when i call i have always had spikes in emotion randomly i go from being great to feeling horrible in a minute when i get in my feelings i just want to talk to my daughter and hear her voice but sometimes her mother doesnt feel like picking up the phone because shes busy which i understand but i lash out if i cant get myself to feel better so in short just pick up the phone are there key moments in your life you think might have led you to where you are today the local juvenile judge had a tough stance on youth offenders he thought it was best to get them when their young i was incarcerated for the first time at years old over a fight that right there took the fear of incarceration out of me i learned to live animalistic as a boy so it

an7xsj,TIFU by baking and eating a spacecake that was way too strong,hi this happened last friday i’m a high school student in my last year in belgium the school system is different anyway i never was a model student but the first years at this school i had pretty good grades then i started to become punky but the teachers still love me because of those first years of me being the nice kids well last friday i ruined that my friends and i enjoy the occasional spliff we tried edibles once before but they totally failed and we didn’t feel anything so last week we decided to bake space brownies and eat them while holding a movie night i was really hyped cause i like cooking and i certainly like weed my mom know i smoke occasionally so i told my friends i’ll bake it at my place i got my mom to agree pointing out that eating it is better for my health than smoking it etc etc so thursday my friends hand me their share and i go buy the weed i buy grams for a recipe that asks for grams and even then the recipe said that that was already too much but dumbass me thought “last time we didn’t feel anything with grams so i should buy more” so i bake the brownies they look great the next day i arrive at school we’re all hyped i give one part to a friend of mine in another class she had a really low tolerance for drugs but she insisted so i gave her a part she ate it an hour later she still didn’t feel anything so i decided to take a piece the brownies were delicious i took one two three four fucking parts cause i thought “what’s the worst that could happen” i hand some to other friends of them are in my class aren’t so yeah the day continues but then the first one who took the cake like an hour before us shows up in panic she’s almost crying she has never been this high from one part and then i feel it i’m starting to get high we go to class my friends and i are half dead almost sleeping on our benches i am so fucking stoned out of my mind the rest of the class is discreetly laughing at us one guy tells me he wants a part the teacher asks who’s absent one smartass says “some of us are only present physically but are absent mentally” anyway the lesson goes by then we walk out of the classroom and one of my friends starts puking in the bin the teachers gets suspicious and tells us to go to the principal yay we’re at the principal’s office she knows we’re stoned but we keep telling her we ate at the same snackbar and we ate something bad she keeps saying she doesn’t believe us until a friend of mine snaps and tells her the truth she starts laughing and soon enough the entire direction of the school a few students and some teachers show up and everyone thinks it’s hilarious it was tbh so the principal tells us we need to call our parents to pick us up and tell them the truth i call my mom i tell her we ate the spacecake at school her exact words were “are you dumb” i loved it she was so fucking sassy so we get picked up now we’re gonna have to sign a document saying we’ll never do weed again in scholar context of my classmate friends who took parts of the brownies aren’t allowed to hang out with me and the others anymore we are labelled the dumbass junkies of the school i’m never getting laid again today i passed the principals office and she fucking laughed at me i was dead stoned about hours in total needless to say we did not do movie night my friends from the other classes didn’t get caught the girl who took the first brownie just left school her bf picked her up another guy was also dead in the class but the teachers didn’t notice him the other students did though and he didn’t feel his body for hours that was fucked up like he could slap himself he wouldn’t feel it and the last guy was stoned but pretty okay even though he had to do a test and he still got an a don’t ask me how he pulled that off he actually smoked weed later that night with his cousins so yeah imma take a break from weed cause ducking hell i was gonna die tldr ate parts of spacecake at school you can imagine the rest,hi happened last friday high school student last year belgium school system different anyway never model student first years school pretty good grades started become punky teachers still love first years nice kids well last friday ruined friends enjoy occasional spliff tried edibles totally failed feel anything last week

2pskz2,[TH] That crazy time me and my little brother were drug dealers,i just want to start out the story by telling you a little about my brother and i im and my brother is were from eastern nebraska and we moved to the east coast about a year ago we lived in philadelphia for about a eight months then we moved to orlando florida i wont specify what suburb we lived in and went to school at before i start in on all this i feel like its important that you have a physical description of us im white tall with a broad build my litttle brother is even bigger then me a chubby kid with alot of muscle mass so our drug dealing shenanigans began when my brother and i were smoking out of a homemade bong by our pool my brother had bought about an ounce of weed from this big black dude with dreads that went to our school we had more weed then we could smoke so we started selling dimes to our friends we honestly ripped them off pretty hard bucks for a gram we never sold more then a gram at a time we were always able to reup from the black dude with dreads sorry thats not his name but thats how im going to address him deal with it we were making about bucks a week and that was just profit so i wasnt complaining eventually i got nervous about selling in school so i just quit selling all together i just referred my friends to my little brother who obviously was still selling and my brother still cut me in half so this is where it gets intense i was standing in my kitchen when my little brother walks in the front door at like o clock at night i asked did you sell that dime to nicole expecting he had money for me he replied quickly no some kid stole it from me i was shocked and said uhhh what he explained to me how some black kid just walked up while i was showing people the bag and he snatched it and ran youidiotjpg i wasnt that mad about the weed to be honest i was pissed off that someone has the nerve to steal from my little brother i swore to myself that the next day we were going to find whoever the hell did this fast forward to exams the next day we had a sixteen minute break after our th period exam i was walking with my friend mike my little brother comes up to me and said i just saw the kid hes in the cafeteria i said lets go then we walked into the cafeteria and did one sweep and we didnt find him then we turned around and the bell rang shit i didnt want to wait to find this kid so we walked back towards the cafeteria then we did find him he was walking the opposite direction of us so he was on the course to pass us i handed my guitar over to mike i walked past the kid turned around and got next to him i looked right at him and said hey he had headphones in so he didnt hear my but he did notice that i was looking at him he took off his headphones and said what i pointed to my little brother and said do you know this kid thats when he realized he had trouble he immediately replied oh you wana go to the bathroom implying he wanted to fight without interruption pause so this kid is a senior about six foot one black he took his backpack off and put it on the ground he was ready to fight i knew we wouldnt have any problem getting this kid to swing first everybody would see it continuing the kid didnt know who to address he started touching my little brothers stomach threatening to shank him and imma bust you with my we both have seen people like this kid throw out big statements like that thinking they are some kind of big time gangster no just no so hes getting in my brothers face and my little brother wasnt backing down the kid balled up his fist and swung but my little brother saw it and blocked it he then bear hugged the kid and threw him up against the lockers i put down by bag and reached my hands in and grabbed the kid by the neck i popped him twice in the side of the face school security and police were involved within seconds of the altercation i wasnt locked in tight with the kid like my little brother was i got tackled by the school cop he told me to stay down and then he tried to get my little brother off this kid they separated my little brother and the kid my brother disappeared into the crowd the police put the other kids face into the ground and handcuffed him he was resisting like an angry bull how was it that after that my little brother and i could just walk away while the other kid gets handcuffed two reasons were white he swung first at the end of the day we pressed charges on the kid for assault he couldnt talk about us having weed in the bathroom because that would only bring trouble on himself we just ended up with a ten day out of school suspension after our christmas break tldr my little brother and i sold drugs got drugs stolen from us got the kid who stole from us

ca9ep2,I’m finally not a piece of shit,i got my life off to a real bad start i’ve been a thief a liar a cheater an enabler a fake a manipulator and basically just a bottomfeeding scum i’ve taken advantage of people i’ve ruined lives and i’ve hurt my family beyond belief i started dealing drugs when i was for a kid that was bullied and never accepted having something everyone wanted was a way to fit in it was a way of survival i started with weed and thought it was so cool and fun i started getting deeper and deeper as i got more money and made more connections eventually i realized that weed doesn’t make nearly as much money as other drugs do i started selling pills xanax perks adderall psychedelics and coke when i was i got busted with over felonies in one traffic stop i was driving on hydrocodone xanax lean and had been smoking in my car this wasn’t the first time fucking dumbass i’m so lucky i didn’t take someone’s life with my irresponsible actions and selfish behavior anyways when i got busted i had grams of wax ounces of weed a pack of edibles a scale some illegal weapons and the deal breaker was tabs of acid when the pd found the lsd they came up to me and asked what it was as i sat in the car with my hands cuffed “that looks like trash” i said with a blank expression they asked me if i’d be willing to a drug recognition officer “no i would not” i said sternly when they put me in county i pissed hot for every drug on the chart i got out days later with felony charges for the wax no charges for the lsd they took my phone for evidence my car was in the impound and i had no money i walked to a friends house and got a ride back to where i was staying i had cash and went on a spending spree expecting to get raided i ended up finding a lawyer for it took me a few days to consider it but i ended up going with him i wasn’t going to snitch and i was deathly afraid of the lsd charges coming up after a year of being on probation and having to do program i went back to jail times my lawyer was pissed and told me they’ll probably bring back all my charges but he assured me he’ll go to lunch with my prosecutor the k was so worth it i got lucky because they didn’t bring back my charges i walked away with a dui by prescription medication with all the drug charges dropped i dodged years in prison with how many times i fucked up through the probation period and what i got busted with i don’t know how i got so lucky i wish i could say this was the start of a new life for me but it wasn’t i went in harder to cocaine this time after a year of selling it and living that lifestyle i was starting to realize i had to change i came so close to overdosing i accidentally did double the amount i thought i was because i got into a bag of pure and sniffed it like it was cut my eyes were shaking and palpitations were uncontrollable my nose was bleeding and my head was aching i kept falling asleep and waking up with my heart beating out of my chest i thought i was going to die i wrote a note to my mom saying i’m sorry and to the person who found my dead body i told them i didn’t mean to do this and i’m sorry for them finding me here i didn’t sleep that night but i didn’t die either after this i got serious about changing i started hitting the gym and stopped hanging out with my friends as much they didn’t like that i wasn’t partying with them anymore so things were weird i moved out of that house and moved in with a girl i’d be seeing another motivation to change we moved minutes away to a different town i started over taking a job at minimum wage after month i had works up to a supervisor position at hr the environment was toxic and i couldn’t continue there so i got a new job as a manager of a health food store started taking my diet seriously and my brain started working again my dreams were coming back and i had a clarity on who i was but still didn’t know what i wanted to do tough times pushed me around and made me unsure of my future the health food store fired me for some bullshit and things were rocky i got a new job with a great boss and a ton of freedom my boss opened the door for me to make money on the side doing my own thing i started hustling like never before and making a name for myself i became financially stable and things were going good i started going to martial arts and training brazilian jiujitsu since started training years ago i’ve competed times bringing home gold medals some of which being the colorado state championship national tournament and some big name submission only i’m working on starting my own business now and just got my first client paying month this all happened in less than years and it’s amazing how much life can change i went from a drug dealing lost kid ruining lives to now i’m an influence amongst everyone i know i teach a kids martial arts class and i’m a bright light to anyone i meet i still slip up here and there and fall back into the mentality but this process is beautiful i’m finally becoming who i’m meant to be and i’m gonna keep rising i started this page theprocess on instagram to document my progress as i grow and develop in hopes i can inspire others that are lost without direction crazy how fast life can do a complete turn around when you’re hungry and focused if you made it here to the bottom i love and appreciate you keep up

9kk0g4,Imma be honest with you chief,this video ain’t it i have a problem with this video the women agreeing and the men agreeing but especially the women see i have a problem with these men these men who think everything about a woman revolves about them this man definition of queen is a natural beauty someone who don’t have surgery « real faces real bodies real attitude » there’s two things that infuriates me worth being determined by your body im tired of people valuing a woman by her body what’s the first thing people use to attack a woman her body i remember lurking into the shade room and there was that jlo post in the gym showing off in the sport bra and leggings and people in the comment were asking why people give pass to jlo but bernice burgos and nicki got dragged about their age and the comments were about « jlo has a natural body » women and men decided that respect not dragging someone and letting them live was due based on if your body was real or not i’m disgusted by the pick me agreeing to this because they call themselves feminist and prone respect for women and all that shit but drags a woman for her body in case people haven’t realized this man standards are built to please him he woke up and decided that a queen had the standards that pleased him pleased he’s saying to be a queen she has to please me i’m weirded by how men are valued on their ability to provide which for me should be a standard women or men their ability to be independent no one praise a momma boy who lives in the basement they’re even applaud for the behaviour that’s shunned upon women aka sleeping around imma be honest there’s a difference between a player and hoe male or female having game charisma seduction is totally different from throwing your pussy around sticking your dick in everything that has a whole and men are rarely diminished for their looks we’ve all saw this your home girl is nice cute has her shit together and is with a man that has his shit together and dusty looking when you talk bout his dusty figure she has the “he’s good with kids” “ he’s nice » « he got that d » yet with men you don’t see frequently the scenario because men values looks and when they choose their partner that’s the first thing that comes best believe when they homies says she ugly this woman chances of getting with him lowered down my problem with the video is that this nigga equates respect and self worth to look i saw him using nicki minaj yet nicki is financially successful and has talked about self worth also i know her songs aren’t the same but people need to realize that in raps sex sells and all rappers rap about it she also has more mature songs however if she was a man best believe me she’d be respected i mean jfk done cheating on his wife and stick his stick in many but no one bringing that up also since were at it i’d like to mention that for me a queen is someone who is independent and successful i don’t really consider amber a queen because i feel like she’s using feminism to push her own motives my view i ain’t one of those who uses feminism to justify everything i don’t think myself as a feminist more of an equalitarian or early days feminist while i’m at it i’m going to keep it str people need to stop calling everything empowerment and stop being hypocrites there’s women who dress a little more revealing because they feel sexy and it makes them confident or because they wanna show off or for aesthetic but let’s not act that there isn’t women who dresses in hope to catch the attention cuz at some point some of us want to thirst trap on the gram it’s okay but y’all know damn well at some point it’s for attention there’s women who have unhealthy insecurities risking their mental and physical health for surgery but there’s women who want to fix something and move on there’s women who enjoy some last minute dick it’s okay but you know damn well that at some point having the whole city going through that pussy is fishy and same for men however i don’t think should be discredited solely for having a fake body or sleeping around also nobody praising fake bodies stop lying to yourselves people call out fake body all the time as soon as the body is known to be fake people don’t give the same treatment that they give to natural body,video problem video women agreeing men agreeing especially women see problem men men think everything woman revolves man definition queen natural beauty someone surgery real faces real bodies real attitude two things infuriates worth determined body im tired people valuing woman body first thing people use attack woman body remember lurking shade room jlo post gym showing sport bra leggings people comment asking people give pass jlo bernice burgos nicki got dragged age comments jlo natural body women men decided respect dragging someone letting live due based body real disgusted pick agreeing call feminist prone respect women shit drags woman body case people realized man standards built please woke decided queen standards pleased pleased saying queen please weirded men valued ability provide standard women men ability independent one praise momma boy lives basement even applaud behaviour shunned upon women aka sleeping around imma honest difference player hoe male female game charisma seduction totally different throwing pussy around sticking dick everything whole men rarely diminished looks saw home girl nice cute shit together man shit together dusty looking talk bout dusty figure good kids nice got yet men see frequently scenario men values looks choose partner first thing comes best believe homies says ugly woman chances getting lowered problem video nigga equates respect self worth look saw using nicki minaj yet nicki financially successful talked self worth also know songs people need realize raps sex sells rappers rap also mature songs however man best believe respected mean jfk done cheating wife stick stick many one bringing also since like mention queen someone independent successful really consider amber queen feel like using feminism push motives view one uses feminism justify everything think feminist equalitarian early days feminist going keep str people need stop calling everything empowerment stop hypocrites women dress little revealing feel sexy makes confident wan na show aesthetic let act women dresses hope catch attention cuz point us want thirst trap gram okay know damn well point attention women unhealthy insecurities risking mental physical health surgery women want fix something move women enjoy last minute dick okay know damn well point whole city going pussy fishy men however think discredited solely fake body sleeping around also nobody praising fake bodies stop lying people call fake body time soon body known fake people give treatment give natural body
